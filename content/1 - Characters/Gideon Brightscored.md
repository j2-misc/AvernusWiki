> *"The four of you have an aura I don't trust."*

A vampiric monster and worshipper of [[Zariel]] who briefly resided in a chapel of [[Lathander|The Morninglord]] following [[Elturel#The Descent|Elturel's Descent]]. Him and his cronies slew [[Lina]] and the other acolytes at the chapel, and captured [[Zythan Avhoste]] in an attempt to force the diviner to alter [[The Helm of Torm]] to be able to contact [[Zariel]] ([[Session 5, 31 July 2024 - Graveyard Shift|Session 5]]).
# Gideon's Testament
A tome filled with a record of conversations Gideon had with a being he described as divinity beyond divinity, [[Zariel|The Woman in White]]. 

Some excerpts:
> *G: “Tell me: what is the greatest evil?”*
> *W: “It is that of the Abyss. It is a teeming horde of chaos that seeks to rip down civilization”*
> *G: “And why should civilization not be destroyed?”*
> *W: “It is what gives life meaning, the origin of morality and thought, of art and science.”*

> *Her beauty was so bright it seemed to blind my eyes but… (it continued to describe the woman’s beauty and her fall from grace, wings severed). It’s the gods’ place to stand between man and chaos.*

From the final transcript:
> *G: “But why did you turn from the light”*
> *W: “I turned from the light because it blinded me.”*
> *G: “Is it not the light that lets us see?”*
> *W: “That is the lie of the light, we think only of what it illuminates, not what it conceals from us.”*

> *The great blindness, the great lie is that the gods protect man from chaos. They are inactive in the war against chaos. That is why Zariel turned from heaven, because she saw the truth of her holy purpose, to stand between man and chaos. It is hell that fights eternal so mortals can live a few meager years on the material plane.*
