![[Zythan.png]]
A half-elf hailing from the cosmopolitan city of [[Waterdeep]], Zythan has been a long-time member of the [[Lords' Alliance]], a political alliance between the Forgotten Realms' major powers. Zythan primarily practices divination magic, typically with the purpose of ascertaining historical knowledge. He has come to [[Elturel]] with the intended goal of offering Elturel membership into the Lords' Alliance, but a concerning portent regarding the city's well-being has caused him to further look into Elturel's affairs. He has an analytical but humorless demeanor, and while he often struggles to socialize with others, he finds joy in sharing his discoveries and theories.
