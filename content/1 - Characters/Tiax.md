![[Tiax.png]]
A gnome pugilist and enjoyer of alcohol the party freed from [[The Tower of Urm]]. Previously, he was employed by "The Great Mage" [[Mordenkainen]] but was abandoned by him when [[Orrim]] sieged the tower, leaving him to be captured and restrained by diamond-studded manacles which prevented him from teleporting away.

After helping the party drive off Orrim and his mercenaries, Tiax helped himself to everything in the liquor cabinet, and saw himself out before Mordenkainen returned.
