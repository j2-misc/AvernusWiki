> *"You not Deevil! Deevil red! And you green."*
> *~ Gargauth the Gentle*

A gigantic gargoyle who appreciates the finer things in life. Namely: kicking *[[Devils|deevils]]*. [[Ilsa-Vyx]] made friends with him when she found him laughing and kicking *deevils* in [[Westerly]] on the way to rescue [[Zythan Avhoste]] from his captors at [[The Grand Cemetery]] ([[Session 4, 3 July 2024 - The Battle of Elturel pt. 2|Session 4]]). He also later helped the party descend from [[Elturel]] into [[Avernus|The Avernan Wastes]].

He doesn't remember much beyond [[Koh Tam]] or the simple directive that "kicking dee-vils" and helping humans is good ([[Session 16, 6 November 2024 - Moments of Calm|Session 16]]).
