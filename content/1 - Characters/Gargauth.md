A gigantic gargoyle who appreciates the finer things in life. Namely: kicking *[[Devils|deevils]]*. [[Ilsa-Vyx]] made friends with him when she found him laughing and kicking *deevils* in [[Westerly]] on the way to rescue [[Zythan Avhoste]] from his captors at [[The Grand Cemetery]] ([[Session 4, 3 July 2024|Session 4]]). He also later helped the party descend from [[Elturel]] into [[Avernus|The Avernan Wastes]].
