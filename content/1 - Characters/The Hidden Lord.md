In life, The Hidden Lord was a wizard who sought to study [[Baator]]. He was working on a [[Staff of Power]] before he died and was trapped in the shield to be used by [[Zalryr]] and his cult. Now, The Hidden Lord travels with [[Kiarin]] and has formed an alliance with the party. He's asked them to find the pieces of the Staff of Power, because if it's put together, it could spell freedom for [[Elturel]].

Later he was forced by [[Lulu]] to reveal that he was forced to work for [[Lord Yashio]] the [[Demon Lord]] at [[Idyllglen|the Battle of Idyllglen]]. He also took the time to share his real name with the party, Karnivash, in a largely unsuccessful bid to regain their trust, despite [[Kiarin]]'s best efforts ([[Session 15, 16 October 2024 - Lulu's Rapture|Session 15]]).
