In life, The Hidden Lord was a wizard who sought to study [[Baator]]. He was working on a [[Staff of Power]] before he died and was trapped in the shield to be used by [[Zalryr]] and his cult. Now, The Hidden Lord travels with [[Kiarin]] and has formed an alliance with the party. He's asked them to find the pieces of the Staff of Power, because if it's put together, it could spell freedom for [[Elturel]].
