*Art by the incomparable [FlawlessWaffles](https://flawlesswaffless.artstation.com/)*

A Drow thief, magician, and traveling musician, Kiarin has made a name for herself robbing tombs and towers alike (and the occasional performance, where she would sometimes cross paths with [[Evryn]]). Originally hailing from [[Waterdeep]] where she grew up with [[Ilsa-Vyx]], Kiarin found herself working for [[The Collector]] with [[Mekhi]]. The two of them traveled with [[Zythan Avhoste]] to [[Elturel]] in search of a [[The Hidden Lord|shield]].
