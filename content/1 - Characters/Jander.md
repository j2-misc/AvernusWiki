One of [[Zariel|Zariel]]'s five generals alongside [[Haruman|Haruman]], [[Olanthius|Olanthius]], [[Lady Yael|Lady Yael]], and [[Lulu|Lulu]]. Of the five he seemed the most timid.

The party later found him at [[Haruman's Hill|Haruman's Hill]], impaled on the highest tree of steel ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024 - Haruman's Hill|Session 10]]). There he revealed he once fought against a [[Vampire]], [[Cassiar]], and emerged victorious but was corrupted in the process. He acquired a ring that protected him from the effects of sunlight and became one of [[Zariel]]'s generals when he swore to fight for her. She saw in him the desire to fight against evil despite what he was, and she accepted him. However, when the [[Hellriders]] of [[Idyllglen]] rode into the lower planes to seek vengeance against the [[Demons]], Jander refused to lead his soldiers to death. [[Haruman]], then a reborn as a [[Narzugon]] under Archdevil Zariel, saw this as a betrayal and hanged Jander and his twenty or so Hellriders from the steel trees of [[Haruman's Hill]] ([[Session 11, 11 September 2024 - To Exile|Session 11]]).
