> *“And I’m Lulu! I’m basically Zariel’s best friend :) You can count on me to do what’s right! :3”*

One of [[Zariel]]'s five generals alongside [[Haruman]], [[Olanthius]], [[Lady Yael]], and [[Jander]]. Lulu is a golden, optimistic, magical elephant creature.

She was later found enchanted to be a waitress at [[The Infernal Rapture]] working as a slave for [[Mahadi]]. She recounted that in the wake of [[Zariel]]'s fall from divinity, Olanthius asked her to complete some task, but she was intercepted by Mahadi and since then, one-hundred and forty years have passed ([[Session 15, 16 October 2024 - Lulu's Rapture#So who are you guys?|Session 15]]).

As a hollyphant, she has the ability to transform into a giant, winged wooly mammoth (as seen in [[Session 16, 6 November 2024 - Title Pending|Session 16]]).
