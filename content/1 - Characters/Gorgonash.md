A horrible [[Demons|Demon]] who feasts on the souls of all he devours, reduced to nothing more than a treasure inspector for [[Aurumvas]] during his stint at [[The Fallen Tower]]. The party was able to fairly easily convince them to help them only by promising that if he helped them kill Aurumvas then he could eat him. Despite the insatiable bloodlust, he was fairly level-headed ([[Session 19, 27 November 2024 - Union Dues|Session 19]]).
