![[Mekhi.jpg]]
An Orc bruiser from [[Elturel]], Mekhi is a warlock who uses strange magics to augment his versatile set of weapons as well as his own body. He has a bit of a bad reputation and a history with [[Ilsa-Vyx]] on opposite sides of the law. He and [[Kiarin]] work for the same benefactor, [[The Collector]], engaging in occasional less-than-legal acts.
