![[KohTam.png]]
A celestial, scholar of the [[Baator|Nine Hells]], and acquaintance of [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]]. A frequent patron of [[Fort Knucklebones|The Well]].

The party sought information from him, or any help he could provide in freeing [[Elturel|Elturel]]. He suggested a bizarre idea: if a celestial could fall and become a devil, then perhaps a devil could rise and become celestial once more. He suggested that if the party could somehow *redeem* [[Zariel|Zariel]], then she could free Elturel ([[Session 8, 21 August 2024|Session 8]]).
