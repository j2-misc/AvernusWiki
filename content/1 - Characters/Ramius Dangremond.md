![[Ramius.png]]
High Rider Ramius has served as the commander of the [[Hellriders]], Elturel's primary military force, for just under a month. A devout paladin of [[Tyr]], he is eager to defend [[Elturel]] from threats within and without, and aims to enforce justice and order throughout the city. He has a strong, forceful personality, presenting an intimidating veneer, but oftentimes proves to be quite gregarious and 
light-hearted.

Ramius is the most recent in a long lineage of High Riders, and he is proud to fill the shoes of his father, and his father before him ([[Session 1, 12 June 2024 - The Gathering|Session 1]]).
