title: Orrim, Tower Thief
---
A somewhat canine-looking humanoid-ish mage who was mysteriously incapable of harm at the hands of the party. Orrim hired [[Yugoloths|Yugoloth mercenaries]] to help him in claiming [[The Tower of Urm]] which he held onto long enough to take care of whatever business he had there. His mercenaries killed or driven off by the party with the help of [[Tiax]], Orrim left partly out of boredom and swore to bring woe to the party at a later date ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024|Session 10]]).
