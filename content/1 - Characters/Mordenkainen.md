![[Mordenkainen.png]]
Mordenkainen is a mage of some renown obsessed with the concept of, "the multiversal balance between law and chaos," and doing nothing useful ever. Given any opportunity, he would describe himself as the greatest mage with the most powerful magic and the keenest mind. Despite having the ability to free [[Elturel]] from [[Avernus]] at any time, he chooses not to because, "it would probably disturb The Balanceâ„¢ or something." He is the current owner of [[The Tower of Urm]].

Thus far, the only useful thing he has done for anyone ever has been granting [[Ilsa-Vyx]] a [[Heward's Pouch of Seasonings|magical pouch of spices]]. After which, he swiftly returned to being useless to anyone and everyone around him ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024|Session 10]]).
