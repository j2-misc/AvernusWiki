A strange creature [[Ilsa-Vyx]] witnessed after lagging behind the party at [[Haruman's Hill]] ([[Session 11, 11 September 2024|Session 11]]).

Unbeknownst to the party, the strange horse reported back to [[Zariel]] that [[Jander]] was freed from [[Haruman's Hill]] by four mortals, and for its loyalty it was transformed into a more powerful fiend ([[Session 12, 25 September 2024#Interlude|Session 12 Interlude]]).

It sought out the party and attacked at the [[Lake of Slime]] shortly thereafter ([[Session 13, 4 October 2024|Session 13]]).
