title: Celosia Moondancer, Saint of the Exiles
---
Celosia appears to be a pale woman with shoulder-length blonde hair similar to her son, [[Evryn]]'s, and often wears a smile.

According to [[Ramius Dangremond]], she disappeared roughly thirteen years before [[Elturel#The Descent|Elturel's Descent]] ([[Session 1, 12 June 2024 - The Gathering|Session 1]]). Evryn saw her as a warrior in the vision granted by [[The Helm of Torm]] before [[Idyllglen|The Razing of Idyllglen]] ([[Session 6, 7 August 2024 - Idyllglen|Session 6]]). Later, at [[Haruman's Hill]] after rescuing [[Jander]] and his [[Hellriders]], the party encountered [[The Hells' Exiles]], who worked for Celosia under the alias Cockscomb. The party traveled with the Exiles to [[Exiles' base|their base]] where Evryn reunited with his mother for the first time in over a decade ([[Session 11, 11 September 2024 - To Exile|Session 11]]).

Celosia supposedly has the power to restore lowly fiendish monsters like [[Lemure|Lemures]], such as with [[Hellripper]].
