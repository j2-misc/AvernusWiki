title: Jade Strongwind, Bad News
---
One of [[Ilsa-Vyx]]'s mothers, Jade was a barbarian of great power and renown who ventured into [[Waterdeep|Undermountain]] and found her fortune there with [[The Bad News Brigade]]. A few years ago, however, Jade went missing, and though she occasionally wandered off for a while at a time, this time felt off, prompting [[Ilsa-Vyx]] to strike out in search of her.
