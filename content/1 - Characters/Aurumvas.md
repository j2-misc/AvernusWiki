Aurumvas is the [[Demons|Demon]] of Avarice. Previously he was a mighty and terrible Demon, striking fear into the hearts of all who saw his shadow cast over whatever battlefield lay next in his path. Recently, he's taken residence in [[The Fallen Tower]] where he chooses to sit on his wealth and mint new coins, much to the chagrin of his bloodthirsty servants. After the events of [[Session 19, 27 November 2024 - Union Dues|Session 19]], it is possible if not likely the [[Demon Lord]] will make a return to prominence.
