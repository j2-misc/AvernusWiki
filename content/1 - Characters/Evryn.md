Evryn is a human storyteller and bard, with a particular fixation on picking up new tales on his travels. His mother, [[Celosia]], went missing around thirteen years ago, and after traveling around on his own for some time (where he occasionally crossed paths with another musician, [[Kiarin]]), he settled briefly in [[Elturel]]. There he met and [roomed with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0iM3bkkpbI) [[Ilsa-Vyx]], a [[Hellriders|Hellrider]], in order to sate his hunger for knowledge on the history of the faction.
