One of [[Zariel]]'s five generals alongside [[Olanthius]], [[Lady Yael]], [[Jander]], and [[Lulu]]. He was later slain by the party after his becoming a [[Narzugon]] ([[Session 4, 3 July 2024|Session 4]]).

According to [[Jander]], Haruman's becoming a Narzugon was the breaking point for Jander and his [[Hellriders]], who refused to swear fealty to a fiend. For this, Haruman hanged them from the steel trees on [[Haruman's Hill]], where they remained for countless years ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024|Session 10]], [[Session 11, 11 September 2024|11]]).
