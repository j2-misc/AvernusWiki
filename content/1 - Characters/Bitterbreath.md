![[Bitterbreath.png]]
A [[Devils|Devil]] who commanded a squad of other Devils ([[The Marauders]]) seemingly interested in the procurement of [[Infernal War Machine|Infernal War Machines]]. Bitterbreath used to operate [[The Meat Grinder]], but the party--with some help from [[Feonor]]--was able to drive him off. Unfortunately they had to part with the machine, keeping only [[The Tormentor]] thanks to some gunboat diplomacy on Feonor's part ([[Session 8, 21 August 2024|Session 8]]).
