![[Thavius.png]]
A cleric of [[Torm]], High Overseer Thavius is the elderly, theocratic leader of [[Elturel]]. Thavius rose to prominence fifty years ago, when his fervent prayers to Torm resulted in a divine miracle during a vampiric invasion of Elturel. This miracle created [[The Companion|The Blazing Companion]] in Elturel's sky, burning the invaders to ash and rewarding Thavius with the position of High Overseer. He has a mild and reserved personality, preferring to keep himself busy with managing the city's affairs.

Secretly, the Companion was a result of a pact with [[Zariel]], which was later used by [[Zalryr]]'s cult to drag Elturel into [[Avernus]] in a twisted act of petty vengeance ([[Session 2, 19 June 2024|Session 2]]).
