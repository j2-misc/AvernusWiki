Lania was an acolyte at [[The Grand Cemetery]] who ran away from home and found faith and a family; Old Silver, Homestead, and Gretchen. She was killed and her soul captured in a [[Soul Coin]] by [[Gideon Brightscored]] and the [[Zariel|Zarielites]] that took over the cathedral during [[Elturel#The Descent|Elturel's Descent]]. [[Evryn]] buried her and her family, setting their souls to rest.
