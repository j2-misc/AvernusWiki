# The Story So Far
[[Elturel]] was dragged into [[Avernus]] by the Archdevil [[Zariel]], who was the true creator of [[The Companion]] per a pact made with [[Thavius Kreeg|The High Overseer, Thavius Kreeg]]. [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]] asked the party to help save Elturel, and so the party set out to make alliances, gather supplies, and learn about Avernus.

This took them to [[Fort Knucklebones]] where they fixed up an [[Infernal War Machine]] and rode it to a [[The Tower of Urm]] where they fought some [[Yugoloths]].
