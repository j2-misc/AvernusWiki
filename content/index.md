# The Story So Far
[[Elturel]] was dragged into [[Avernus]] by the Archdevil [[Zariel]], who was the true creator of [[The Companion]] per a pact made with [[Thavius Kreeg|The High Overseer, Thavius Kreeg]]. [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]] asked the party to help save Elturel, and so the party set out to make alliances, gather supplies, and learn about Avernus.

This took them to [[Fort Knucklebones]] where they fixed up an [[Infernal War Machine]] and rode it to a [[The Tower of Urm]] where they fought some [[Yugoloths]]. From there they traveled to [[Haruman's Hill]] where they rescued [[Jander]] and his [[Hellriders]], and traveled with [[Hellripper]] to [[Exiles' base]] where they met [[Celosia|Evryn's mother]].

Evryn had a tense conversation with Celosia, and he was upset for her abandoning him and [[Evryn's father|his father]], having disappeared without a trace over a decade prior, and he couldn't even bring himself to be upset with her because she was straining her magic to the point of collapse on numerous occasions to help [[The Hells' Exiles]]. After a day's rest, the party set out for the [[Lake of Slime]] in order to find a fragment of the [[Staff of Power]], per the recommendation of [[The Hidden Lord]]. They took a detour to [[Levistus's Emissary]] where they spoke with [[Levistus|the titular archdevil]], and after some conversation accepted a deal in which they would dam a stream of [[The River Styx]] to revive the creature that'd been decomposed into the Lake of Slime, [[Shummrath]] an old enemy of Zariel's. Having signed a contract with [[Levistus]], the party continued on their way to the Lake of Slime.

After freeing [[Shummrath]] and being briefly accosted by [[Raragin]] at [[Zariel]]'s behest, the party made for [[The Wandering Emporium]], taking [[Koh Tam]]'s ferry across [[The River Styx]]. There, [[Mahadi]] invited them to [[The Infernal Rapture]] where they stole away with [[Gargauth]], [[Lulu]], and [[The Meat Grinder]] in tow, leaving the restaurant in shambles. After escaping the chaos, [[Lulu]] informed the party they'd need to find [[The Sword of Zariel]] in [[the cyst]] in order to redeem the [[Archdevil]] and free [[Elturel]]. At the same time, tension brewed as [[The Hidden Lord]]--real name [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]]--was forced to reveal he was forced to work for [[Lord Yashio]] the [[Demon Lord]] at [[Idyllglen|the Battle of Idyllglen]].

Since then the party returned to [[Elturel]] briefly where [[Demons]] seem to be winning the conflict against the [[Devils]] at the foot of the chains binding the floating city. After returning [[Gargauth]] and [[Lulu]] to safety, and speaking with [[Ramius Dangremond|Ramius]] and [[Zythan Avhoste|Zythan]], the party set out for [[The Crypt of the Hellriders]]. Along the way, Evryn won a duel with the Devil [[Hezmond]], and the party took on a stowaway by the name of [[Uldrak]], a [[Fire Giant]] turned [[Spined Devil]] by infernal magic.

Upon reaching [[The Crypt of the Hellriders]], the party was tested by [[Page, the Facilitator]] and they took part in a nightmare of a battle between [[Olanthius]] and [[Lady Yael]] against [[Shummrath]] and a much different [[Gargauth]]. After this, and a brief run-in with a mere facsimile of [[Asmodeus]], the party met with Olanthius and he agreed to travel with them. 

They made a brief stop at [[The Fallen Tower]] to pick up another one of the fragments of the [[Staff of Power]], a pursuit with which Mekhi was growing increasingly uncomfortable, as he grew less content to capitulate to the demands of [[The Collector]].
