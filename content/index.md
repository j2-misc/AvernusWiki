[[Mekhi]] is a bruiser out to save his [[Elturel|hometown]], [[Evryn]] and [[Ilsa-Vyx]] are [[Hellriders]] on the search for their mothers, and [[Kiarin]] is a thief on the run from hers.
# The Story So Far
[[Elturel]] was dragged into [[Avernus]] by the Archdevil [[Zariel]], who was the true creator of [[The Companion]] per a pact made with [[Thavius Kreeg|The High Overseer, Thavius Kreeg]]. [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]] asked the party to help save Elturel, and so the party set out to make alliances, gather supplies, and learn about Avernus.

This took them to [[Fort Knucklebones]] where they fixed up an [[Infernal War Machine]] and rode it to a [[The Tower of Urm]] where they fought some [[Yugoloths]]. From there they traveled to [[Haruman's Hill]] where they rescued [[Jander]] and his [[Hellriders]], and traveled with [[Hellripper]] to [[Exiles' base]] where they met [[Celosia|Evryn's mother]].

Evryn had a tense conversation with Celosia, and he was upset for her abandoning him and [[Evryn's father|his father]], having disappeared without a trace over a decade prior, and he couldn't even bring himself to be upset with her because she was straining her magic to the point of collapse on numerous occasions to help [[The Hells' Exiles]]. After a day's rest, the party set out for the [[Lake of Slime]] in order to find a fragment of the [[Staff of Power]], per the recommendation of [[The Hidden Lord]]. They took a detour to [[Levistus's Emissary]] where they spoke with [[Levistus|the titular archdevil]], and after some conversation accepted a deal in which they would dam a stream of [[The Styx]] to revive the creature that'd been decomposed into the Lake of Slime, [[Shummrath]] an old enemy of Zariel's. Having signed a contract with [[Levistus]], the party continued on their way to the Lake of Slime.
