- Mekhi asked some more questions about [[Bel's Forge]], away from the rest of the party

- The party spoke with [[Rinne]] and [[Kara]] and agreed to take them to [[Levistus's Emissary]] at a later date
- Finally, though, they set out for [[The River Styx|The Styx]] to find [[Koh Tam]] in order to ask for his help in reviving Celosia
# Verbose
## With the Giants
The party scavenged the battlefield and spoke with [[Uldrak]] and [[Thiodon]] about getting a rampart added to [[The Meat Grinder]]. First though, they'd need to sort out some details with [[Hellripper]]. After the rest of the party left, [[Mekhi]] asked again about [[Bel's Forge]].

"Let's just say I found a way into there and I got a magical artifact to break... how would I actually do that?"

Thiodon's expression darkened as she answered, "most magic items can be melted in the magma of the forge. It's in a volcano and the magma is hot enough to melt anything given enough time. If you can submerge the object for at least a minute it should be enough."

"You can just toss it in there?"

"Yeah"

"And uh... I don't know how familiar you are with possessed or cursed items, but... if the magic item is destroyed the curse is destroyed with it, yeah?"

"I don't know. Don't know much about curses."

"Guess I'll find out. See you soon."
## Hellripper
Evryn spoke with [[Hellripper]]. She urged the party to set out soon, as [[Celosia]] wasn't getting any worse, but she certainly wasn't getting any better. And unfortunately they didn't have any way to stay in contact long distance. Also, with the battle, the [[Exiles' base]] was no longer safe. The party suggested they move to [[Elturel]].

"I agree, but... the city you mentioned... isn't Elturel in trouble, too?"

"It's [[Baator|Hell]]," Evryn answered simply.

Still, Hellripper was unwilling to move without first consulting Celosia, so awakening her was their top priority.
## Rinne
[[Rinne]] sat by herself holding [[Kara]]'s [[Soul Coin]]. They invited her to tag along with them to get [[Koh Tam]] and bring him to [[Celosia]] in the hopes he could reawaken her, but she decided to wait instead until the party could help her. Kara asked Evryn specifically if he could take them to [[Levistus]]. He was the reason they were in this mess to begin with, but they had some leverage over him. Luckily enough, Ilsa-Vyx had held onto a weird levistus rock that allowed her to contact him from a distance.
## Levistus
The party stepped outside and contacted [[Levistus]]. Ilsa-vyx handed the stone to [[Rinne]].

"I want [[Kara|my sister]] back," she said, "and I want to be free. You know what leverage my sister has over you."

After a moment of silence the icy rock pulsed three times and Rinne, unnerved, said that Levistus demanded to meet with her and [[Kara]]. The sisters needed some time to think of a plan first. In the meantime the party could take care of the rest of the business they had with [[The Hells' Exiles|the Exiles]].
## Olanthius
[[Olanthius]] seemed to have been speaking with some of [[The Hells' Exiles|the Exiles]], but they seemed generally unnerved. They convinced him to travel with them to meet with [[Koh Tam]]
