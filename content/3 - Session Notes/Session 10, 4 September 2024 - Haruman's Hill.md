# Verbose
Evryn and Ilsa-vyx fought some Yugoloths while Kiarin and Mekhi tried to steal from a wizard. The man had almost canine facial features, his ears a little too pointy for a human. He seemed to be casting some sort of a spell. Mekhi decided the best course of action at this point in time was to leap through the window and initiate a smash-and-grab. Inside the room was the man, as previously noticed, but behind him was a desk atop which sat a purple frog-like creature.

[[Orrim|The wizard]] exclaimed, “Who are you?!”

“Shut up,” Mekhi commanded, dispelling the magic. “Alright, thanks.”

Kiarin then quickly suggested (using the power of [[The Hidden Lord]]) that he check on his guards instead of worrying about what she and Mekhi were up to. Somehow, this worked. Kiarin started stealing stuff (magical components, a scrying orb) before running upstairs, while Mekhi dealt with the weird frog.

The wizard made his way downstairs to try and help the [[Yugoloths]] deal with Evryn and Ilsa-vyx. Meanwhile, Kiarin snuck up to the fourth floor to investigate the bedroom. Mekhi then began heading downstairs to back up the rest of the party. On the second floor, he saw a study, with a half-dozen bookshelves, a comfortable-looking chair and a desk, and a giant astrolabe depicting the hells, all illuminated by a warm hearth. Most notably however, he saw a gnome bound by diamond-studded manacles. “Get me out of here!” the gnome cried.

“Anything around here valuable?”

“Dude, if anything were valuable, I would’ve taken it!”

“Ok, well you just- hang tight, and I’ll be back,” he said before continuing downstairs.

Kiarin found an interesting item upstairs, a spectacular rapier with gold trimmings, studded with dark amethyst. It was shiny, sharp, and had been buried under some miscellaneous detritus. Kiarin rushed downstairs, ran into the gnome Mekhi did and freed him. He told her he’d like to join in if they were robbing the place, and that his name was [[Tiax]].

The wizard asked Mekhi, “Why are you even here?!”

“... who, me?”

“You and the others!”

“... I dunno. You have stuff. Well, had stuff.”

“You idiot,” the wizard rolled his eyes and cast a fireball at Mekhi, after which one of the yugoloths fled, citing low payment. Eventually, when Tiax joined the fight, the wizard ([[Orrim]]) reluctantly sighed and teleported away, as none of the party could land a hit on him and he was obviously outmatched by the party. Tiax then took the opportunity to complain about his boss, [[Mordenkainen]], who left immediately when the yugoloths appeared. Mordenkainen might return, and Tiax recommended they just hide the stuff they stole and blame it on the yugoloths. Tiax then made off with all the alcohol. Evryn found a book (which he gave to Kiarin to read).

Shortly thereafter a bald man appeared and congratulated the party on reclaiming the fortress. “Please introduce yourselves to me.”

Mekhi asked, “you’re the Mordenkainen?”

“Yes, I am the Mordenkainen, well-renowned across the multiverse. Thank you four heroes, for saving my tower, my great powerful big tower, from the yugoloths who crossed my borders, illegally to claim my tower as their own tower.”

“Since we saved your tower, can you give us stuff?”

“It is of course in order, but I must first have your word that this thing I’ll give to you that you use it only in the name of multiversal Balance.”

“Yeah, sure.”

“I’ll take you at your word as I hand you this most powerful magical item,” and he handed over a small pouch. “This has the power to disrupt balance throughout the whole multiverse, so you must use it wisely–very smartly, even–it has the power to change the whole world, so you must use it wisely so now here you take it and use it for Balance in the multiverse.”

“Should I open it right now?”

“Don’t open it until you absolutely must.”

“Okay…”

“Umm…” Ilsa-vyx whispered to Mekhi, “Ilsa-vyx is only getting every fourth or fifth word. What does this text on the bag mean, it says ‘Kirkland Signature’? Does it preserve Balance or something?”

“Balance at reasonable rates.”

Kiarin asked Mordenkainen if he could teleport [[Elturel]] out of hell, but he said no because it would be too inconvenient and, “probably disrupt the Balance or something and that’s- I won’t compromise on that, it’s uncompromisable, I’ll never let the Balance between the forces of Law and Chaos be disrupted.” So the party left, and took a short rest in the war machine on the way over to [[Haruman's Hill]].
## On the ride over
Ilsa-vyx smelled [[Heward's Pouch of Seasonings|the pouch]] she got from Mordenkainen and found it smelled of spices. Kiarin identified the rapier she found as one she held before, stolen from the Forge of Fury. This came at the cost of some random person the party ran over when she wasn’t paying attention (+1 rapier; 1d6 manuever (Disarming Strike)).
## Haruman’s Hill
As the party neared [[Haruman's Hill]], they didn’t see anyone, but instead they heard the buzzing of insects, and the screeching of inhuman creatures, and the crumbling of a building past the camp, upon the hill. After Kiarin and Mekhi argued a bit about driving, Evryn approached the damned with Ilsa-vyx in tow. Together, they hoisted the knights off the tree, swatting away bloatflies and sturges alike. The woman they freed, [[Helen]], thanked them and despite being still rattled helped freeing the other knights. In total, they freed about twenty-four knights from the trees imprisoning them.

As they worked, Evryn asked Helen, “How did you and your men get into this situation?”

“We were the only knights who didn’t pledge fealty to Haruman. He became a devil! A devil for Zariel! A devil of all things! So he put us on these trees to suffer, forever I think.”

“How long have you been here?”

A blank look washed over Helen’s face, “I don’t know… a hundred or a thousand years, I don’t- I don’t know. There’s someone at the top who might be able to tell you more. I just need,” she lowered herself to the ground, “I just need to sit.”

Eventually, the party worked their way up the hill to a lone figure impaled on a tree, [[Jander|Jander the Cursed]].
