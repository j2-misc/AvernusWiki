Mekhi began walking down the hallway forward, and encountered a branch to the right. There were two ways before the party, and Mekhi could hear noise to the left. They proceeded that way after restraining the unconscious prisoners. They found a set of double doors and a horned, crimson skull with the same symbol they’d seen earlier impaled on a pike in front of the door. Mekhi smashed it with his maul, destroying the pike in an instant but the skull was undamaged.

Kiarin identified some magic about it. Specifically, the skull was modified with some transmutation magic and the door it was magically tethered to bore some sort of abjuration magic. Physically, the door had traces of blood. Mekhi noticed some traces of blood on the skull as well.

As they headed further in, Mekhi made more sense of the voices up ahead. They were speaking infernal, though he couldn’t understand the language. Kiarin detected the thoughts ahead. The cultists were generally excited about something.

After a while, the party rushed forward. One was a bright red person with corkscrew horns, and a writhing mass of barbed hooks hung from his face like a beard. The other two with him wore bloodied bronze masks. They were quick to react to the party’s presence.

After fighting and killing the devils (one of whom taunted the party as it turned to ash, “You are already damned!”), they took note of a passageway north, and a dirtied shrine which Evryn understood to be an offering shrine to [[Tyr]], the God of Justice. They backtracked and Mekhi flicked some of his blood on the skull which caused the door to slowly creak open. He reasoned that someone had gone through the door recently.

They descended the stairs and saw a library to the left. There was an elven woman and when they approached, she held her hands up in surrender, calm. She was very compliant, but not in a way where it felt she was trying to trick them. “You can call me [[Lina]]. I and the others of this cult hail from Baldur’s Gate. I was assigned to infiltrate them. They’re planning something deadly, and I alone can’t stop them.” She told them that the cult’s leader went by the name of [[Zalryr]]. So far they’d acquired a few fiends: a [[Bearded Devil]] and a few [[Merregons]]. She was the only infiltrator, and worked for the [[Lords' Alliance]], specializing in the destabilization of threats. She feared the cultists were trying to summon something more powerful in the chamber up ahead. She warned them of three more cultists in the other room.

Evryn attempted to help Lina find something useful in the library, and failed, but he did find a book about some cool drow guy with two swords. Mekhi broke open a chest, disarming a trap as he did and found two healing potions, and a journal. He tossed the journal to Kiarin and she identified the person responsible writing it as Zalryr (he kept referring to himself in the third person, like a loser). It described his pilgrimage from Baldur’s Gate, the acquisition of new members, and referred to his master as [[Zariel]]. Evryn recognized the name.

He explained that long ago Zariel was an angel of incredible power. She would go into hell with her followers, other angels and mortals alike, to fight off devils. “I heard that this group went on to become the Hellriders, actually, but… one day, about 150 or so years ago, Zariel led the Hellriders into Avernus to destroy the devils and something happened to her. Any sort of goodness and grace she used to have melted away, and she turned into something else.”

“Hm,” considered Mekhi, “sounds kinda bad,” he added thoughtfully.

As far as Evryn was aware, there were no further details, “but as things stand nowadays, Zariel is hardly a figure to worship or work for.”

The journal described how Zariel had led the pilgrimage from Elturel, gathered followers, and there were so many allusions to “the event,” but towards the end it painted a better picture:

“Zariel’s pact with the old fool will be fulfilled at last. The so-called Companion will reveal its true purpose, and thus plunge the city of traitors into her domain. Zalryr awaits this moment eagerly, and I will play my part in her grand plan. Elturel and its people shall be ours!”

Additionally, earlier Zalryr described finding a shield, claiming it as a gift from his master. He claimed it spoke to him, calling itself the Shield of the Hidden Lord.

They handed the journal off to Lina and asked her to deliver it to [[Ramius Dangremond|The High Rider]] while they dealt with the situation in the dungeon. They continued on and saw a red-haired dwarven woman in the room, hands bound by manacles. She shouted to the party when she saw them, “They’re hiding! They’re hiding!” The cultists jumped out, and Ilsa-vyx downed two of them in an instant. She stepped further into the room and saw into the next one; five other cultists observing components, and a tiefling with a wiry white imp assisting in the ritual. A floating shield hovered by his side, decorated with squiggly, writhing patterns. There was a man in the other room screaming for his life.

Mekhi killed one of the cultists in the other room, and Zalryr chastised the one that yet lived in the room with the party. Evryn then ran into the next room, taking note of a few extra details lost on the party previously. The gnome sacrifice was tied to a board with a rope, and more notably he noticed the [[Thavius Kreeg|The High Overseer Thavius Kreeg]] in the corner. He grabbed the gnome, and began running back out of the room. Cultists tried to put daggers to his flesh, but he was too fast!

As the fight continued, Ilsa-Vyx eventually received a telepathic request from the shield, asking her to take it from the madman Zalryr, saying he’d abused its power. Eventually, they dispatched all the cultists and sent the imp back to hell. Then, [[The Hidden Lord|the shield]] clattered to the ground. It was brass with squiggly lines on it.

As the shield thanked the party for rescuing it, the ground suddenly lurched. They evacuated quickly, unconscious cultists in hand and when they got to the surface they saw the companion was dim. It was surrounded by clouds crackling with lightning, blotting out the stars of the night sky. At last, the clouds formed into a symbol: two wings from a sword.

> **"Cowards! Traitors! Weaklings! Your feeble High Overseer has placed your souls within my grasp. And with my grasping hand, I, Archdevil [[Zariel]], shall drag you down to Avernus where you shall suffer punishment for your sins!"**

Everyone was flung to the ground, and the world became a blend of colors. The sensation permeated everywhere, and when it finally departed they found themselves in a different environment. The odor of ash and brimstone choked their breaths.
