## Zariel's Lair
[[Raragin]] dragged himself into [[Zariel]]'s lair. She asked where the party was, "where is the [[Olanthius|paladin]]?"

Raragin assured her that it would be no matter, that the [[Warlord Gangs]] would intercept and destroy them and [[The Hells' Exiles]] before long. Zariel demanded to know the meaning of this, that his words were different remotely than in person. She demanded his mirror, and Raragin found he'd lost it to the party. Zariel understood now what had happened.

"Understand that you have failed me not once, but twice now."

Raragin bowed his head and asked for a demotion and her forgiveness. Zariel's wrath cooled and she said that she was not a merciful leader. Raragin's head was divorced from his shoulders, his corpse and the trail of ichor trailing behind it, an example for all who would defy her. She would have to evaluate the party herself.
## The Exiles' Base
[[Bitterbreath]] the [[Horned Devil]] leader of [[The Marauders]], and [[Princeps Kovik]] the [[Chain Devil]] leader of [[Eighth Remnant]] rode on the [[Exiles' base]]. The party took defensive positions as [[Hellripper]] crashed into Kovik.

A harpoon was fired at [[Celosia]], and Evryn erased the attacker from existence with a laser bought from [[Mezhikchen]]. Mekhi downed [[The Big Gulp]]. Ilsa-vyx launched him from the catapult at Bitterbreath, and he landed in the cabin. It was Bitterbreath and four [[Merregons]]. A one-sided fight; Bitterbreath would die. Kiarin rammed [[The Meat Grinder]] into Kovik, aiding Hellripper.

The party began destroying cars, throwing [[Devils]] into the Meat Grinder, and soon enough they heard a booming voice echo from the backlines. With a barrel chest and bulging muscles, [[Uldrak]], in all his glory, stood proud on the battlefield. Evryn saw his mother collapse. Uldrak threw a boulder at Kovik's vehicle, destroying it, granting [[Rinne]] the opportunity to strike! The party made short work of the wardlords thereafter, leaving Kovik beaten to death and Bitterbreath reduced to a pile of viscera.

Towards the end of the battle, Mekhi was rendered incapacitated, having come down from his Big Gulp high. He saw the God of the Big Gulp who spoke to him of his sins (drinking too much Big Gulp). He was cursed with **Weakness** (indefinite lightning vulnerability) until he could repent by showing some significant sign of devotion, such as a community event like a potluck.
## Celosia
Evryn went to [[Celosia]]. She wouldn't wake up, but she didn't seem physically injured. He knew that with her magic tapped into herself in some way. Whatever had happened, it certainly wasn't good. She wasn't under the effect of any spell, though. Likely the affliction was from within.

Then, the party heard a fight; [[Olanthius]] had [[Jander]] in a chokehold. Olanthius screamed, "You deserve to die for what you did!" Mekhi tackled him. "Let me go!"

"Are you going to try and kill him again?"

"He deserves it! He left us to die!"

After some convincing, Olanthius swore he wouldn't attempt to kill Jander again. Jander apologized for the whole thing. Mekhi reminded them that their quest was larger than them.

[[Hellripper]] approached Evryn and asked him if Celosia would be alright. "I was going to ask you."

"I've never seen it this bad before," she said with a look of great concern on her face.

In stark contrast, [[Uldrak]] was ecstatic. He thanked the party and returned to [[Thiodon]]. [[Rinne]] remained in the garden to allow the party some privacy and to catch up with her sisetr, [[Kara]]. Olanthius and Jander accompanied the party to Celosia's room.

Evryn asked Olanthius if he could help. He said he had little in the way of medical training, and that all the divine energy within him had long since left. He was surprised Celosia was still in [[Avernus]]. Mekhi asked how she was still alive if Olanthius knew her, and Evryn explained his mother was a [[Celestial]]; an [[Angel]].

Olanthius asked, "Do you know how her magic worked?"

Evryn shook his head, "No, but I assume this isn't a good place for an angel to spend so much of her time."

Jander added that was part of the reason, "Why I and my fellow soldiers... desserted."

Olanthius asked if the party knew anyone with celestial magic, and they tossed out [[Lulu]] and [[Koh Tam]]. Olanthius was surprised Koh Tam was still alive, but it seemed like a good enough plan to seek him out. After a rest, of course.

Evryn played his mother's harp. Kiarin read Celosia's mind and she was thinking of the words she said to Uldrak. She asked him about his past, his family, his culture and she considered his answers as a part of her ritual. If Kiarin had the magical capability, she could likely perform the same ritual. However, she was entirely unresponsive, a fact which Kiarin was unable to immediately tell Evryn.

Hellripper dismissed everyone, warned Jander and Olanthius about fighting, and welcomed Evryn to stay if he liked. Evryn said casually, "in case she wakes up, I want to be here so she's not confused about where she is." Jander was allowed to remain with him.
## Jander
[[Jander]] stood awkwardly.

Eventually, Evryn broke the silence. "You said something a bit ago... you can sit down, you know. You don't have to just stand there."

"Oh, uh, yeah, I'll-" and Jander sat as awkwardly as he stood.

Evryn asked Jander about when he mentioned that [[Celosia]]'s being a [[Celestial]] was part of the reason for his choice to dessert. He wanted to know if there were any other Celestials.

As far as Jander was aware, there were no others, and when asked, he confirmed that Celosia was aware of her role in his decisionmaking. "I convinced her to come back through the portal with me." He continued, "Olanthius is right about one thing: I am a coward. I risked the lives of nearly a hundred men, including your mother. I hope you can forgive me for my cowardice."

"I'm not mad at you," Evryn said simply. "Instead of being upset at you, a big reason of why I can be here today is probably because of what you did."

"Even so, I am haunted. I feel as though I could have done more to sway [[Zariel]]'s mind. To prevent her from marching to her doom in the first place."

"Zariel had how many generals again?"

"Five. Why?"

"And how many of them said it was a bad idea?"

"Just me..."

"And it's your fault for not convincing her to turn around?"

"When you word it like that... your words are sensible, but this feeling of betrayal... living while knowing that hundreds of people died down here rested like a heavy weight upon my chest. I could not live with that accursed knowledge. When I... reappeared down here, I felt as though I'd received proper punishment for my cowardice, for my failure. But God had a different plan. Do you think I deserved to walk free, rather than face punishment?"

Evryn asked, "Do you think she does?"

Confidently, "No."

"Isn't she in the same boat as you?"

"I... it... feels different. She is an angel, and I'm... not."

"You two were pretty good friends before this, right?"

"Yes." He was always confident when speaking of Celosia.

"For what it's worth, I don't think you're a bad person."

"You really mean that?"

Evryn nodded.

"Thank you. I'll do whatever I can."

"I know you will." And Evryn noticed Jander's eyes were more shallow, his skin more pale; he was hungry. Half-jokingly Evryn asked, "You're not going to fall comatose on me too, right?"

"I don't know," Jander said. "But I won't drink blood."

"Yeah... well, I'm going to stay here a bit longer. Go enjoy the festivities."

Jander looked back at Celosia before leaving.
## Mekhi
Mekhi checked in on [[Thiodon]]. He asked about a particular forge, which she warned him against traveling to. "That's [[Bel's Forge]]. [[Bel]] has kept my people enslaved for centuries."

Mekhi suggested being sneaky, but [[Uldrak]] warned him against both being sneaky and being brash. Both would result in being [[Spined Devil]]-ified. Perhaps there was some normal way in. "Maybe make a deal. Not a real deal, no no no, never make a real deal with a [[Devils|Devil]], but a fake deal, maybe."
