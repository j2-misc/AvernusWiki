# Verbose
Mekhi spoke with [[Koh Tam|The Ferryman]] about their destination, [[The Wandering Emporium]]. He warned him about [[Mahadi]], its proprietor, cautioning him against making any deals which he wasn't certain he could afford. Afterwards, Mekhi and Ilsa-vyx had a conversation about whether or not Mekhi was "natty." In a somewhat roundabout fashion, this led to them asking [[Koh Tam]] whether or not there were fish in [[The River Styx|The River Styx]].

"It's not wise to eat anything from the River Styx, unless you have an appetite for [[Demons]]," he said. Then he asked for the party to begin settling their debt, by telling him of their journey so far. Kiarin told Koh Tam about most of the events at [[Haruman's Hill]], without mentioning anything about [[The Hells' Exiles]] ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024 - Haruman's Hill|Session 10]], [[Session 11, 11 September 2024 - To Exile|11]]).

Ilsa-vyx and Mekhi, meanwhile, tried to figure out how to fish in The Styx. They set up a contraption using a wok combined with a block and tackle to create a sort of fishing net with some amount of spice set into the wok to better attract fish. Ilsa-vyx was then sat in the wok to be lowered toward the surface of the river so she could fish better with a traditional line. This was a very smart plan. In fact, Ilsa-vyx quickly felt a tug on her line, called back to Mekhi and they both tugged on their respective lines. In fact, they were so coordinated and strong and cool and smart that the fish-demon flung into Mekhi's face, causing him to drop the line and drop Ilsa-vyx. Conveniently, Kiarin's broom of flying was near enough to grab ahold of to save herself. [[Rinne]] then jumped into action, quickly stabbing the fish-demon to death.

Unfortunately, during the encounter, Koh Tam's lucky hat was lost. He didn't ask Mekhi or Ilsa-vyx for a story after that. They then tried to convince Evryn and Kiarin to help them prepare the demon fish, but for some inane reason they didn't want to eat evil fish-demon, even though Koh Tam described it as, "technically edible if prepared well."

After preparing the fish, Mekhi took a bite. With the spices from the pouch, it wasn't the worst thing he'd ever eaten, but it certainly wasn't good. "That was pretty good," he lied as naturally as he breathed. Ilsa-vyx had a bite second, and it went down alright, as well as it was described. Evryn had a bite as well, and Kiarin tossed the slice given to her overboard.
## Evryn's Tale
[[Koh Tam]] had collected a story from everyone, save for Evryn. He told the story about a goblin named What, who once had another name long lost to time. "This goblin was a great sorcerer back in the day, and led a great many feats of innovation, and I asked what his great secret was, but he never said. What he did say was that while most mortals have but one life, he had many. He was married to some entity of death, let's call her Tabitha, and she loved him dearly so whenever his time came, she would take but a tiny piece of his soul and send the rest of it back, letting him live another life. But she would soon find there was a cost to this. Over time, the goblin began to lose his mind, along with everything that made him himself, going by a new name, 'What'. Eventually, he could no longer recognize his wife, which broke her heart. Tabitha realized she needed to let his soul rest, so when next his soul came her way, she gave him a hug and sent him on his way."

"A tragedy fit for theater," Koh Tam said. "Well done, Evryn. I'm glad you four have traveled with me this time. I hope it is not the last." Up ahead, they saw [[The Wandering Emporium]]. "We are at our journey's end, but if you need another ride, I'll know where to find you."

[[Rinne]] rubbed an eye, muttered something about dust, and offered her services again. "I'd keep you safe in the market. Last chance." The party considered the offer but again declined.
## The Wandering Emporium
A bustling market laid before them, encircled by [[Infernal War Machine|Infernal War Machines]] and enshrouded in the first hint of vibrancy they'd seen in [[Avernus]].

A sign nearby read, "All are welcome. No fighting. No spellcasting. No exceptions." A man greeted them warmly.

![[Mahadi.png]]

This was [[Mahadi]]. They mentioned they knew [[Feonor]] and he invited them to [[The Infernal Rapture]] to attend a dinner show. "My friend, you will feast upon the finest meal you've ever dined upon. A three-course dinner, all catered to your taste, and a riveting entertaining dinner show exclusive to the Infernal Rapture. And, all on me, for your heroism. Tonight, you are my esteemed guests of honor." He presented a ticket to each of them, "simply hand these to a host."

Mahadi also directed the party to [[Z'neth]] if they needed to procure supplies, and [[The Firesnake Forge]] for repairs. "Make yourself at home at [[The Wandering Emporium]]. If there's anything you need, anything at all, I won't be far away."
## Exploring the Market
Kiarin found a collection of purveyors of exotic goods and illicit services, including a contract killer. There was also a silver market, a trio of masked figures advertising a silver shop, perhaps particularly useful against devils. Kiarin checked the bounty board, most of the names and faces belonging to fiends wanted for crimes and personal transgressions. [[Hellripper]] had a sizeable bounty. There was also a slightly less conspicuous bounty for [[Koh Tam]]. His bounty was far smaller, totaling only 1 soul coin or 300 gold. Notably, the art was higher quality than most, and the handwriting was very clean. "Delivering Koh Tam's head yields the listed reward in addition to a powerful favor," and it was stamped with an infernal brand. It was a lesser known brand belonging to [[Asmodeus]], a uniquely subtle mark.

There were also a few bounties for [[Warlord Gangs|Warlords]] like [[Bitterbreath]] (though [[Feonor]] was absent). There was also a bounty for [[Princeps Kovik]], the Warlord of [[Eighth Remnant]].

As Kiarin was leaving, she noticed a [[Chain Devil]] approach the bounty board. 

![[Princeps Kovik.png]]

He took Hellripper's posting off the board, and the Tiefling at the stand said something or other in Infernal. She couldn't understand much, but she heard the name [[Princeps Kovik|Kovik]].
## Provisions Acquisitions
The party approached a [[Z'neth|hobgoblin]] who seemed to match Mekhi's terse energy. They asked if he could supply them with enough food for a city, and of course he couldn't but he could sell them the remainder of his stock for 250 gold. On a closer look, [[Z'neth]] even began to suspect the party was from "[[Elturel|that floating city]]"

"What would that change?"

"Well you'd need a way to carry all this food. Probably [[Fhet'Ahla, the Courier|Fhet'Ahla, the Courier]] could do it." During the conversation, Z'neth offered to give them his whole stock for free so long as they just caused a little ruckus at [[The Infernal Rapture]]. The party was interested, but first they'd have to strike a deal with The Courier to secure transport for the goods to [[Elturel]].

When they found The Courier, a dejected fiend unenthusiastically advertising his services, they asked how much for his services. They'd pay an additional fee for partial secrecy. After some deliberation, significantly inconveniencing Fhet'Ahla, they paid two [[Soul Coin|Soul Coins]] and twenty five gold for the whole ordeal.
## The Curio Shop
While at a Curio shop, Mekhi bought a magical™️, adamantium™️™️ breastplate™️™️™️ for a [[Soul Coin]]. When he reunited with the rest of the party, they informed him it was not magical. He had been scammed. The party went back to demand a refund. After some applying some creative pressure, the party received a full refund.
## The Silver Shop
Ilsa-vyx headed to the Silver Market, with the trio of masked figures who talked in almost-unison. She acquired a magical maul and reunited with the party.
## The Barber Shop
They all headed to [[Burney's Barber Shop]], operated by a [[Burney|bronze dragonborn woman]] of the same name. Ilsa-vyx peer-pressured Evryn into getting his hair washed and braided. At the same time, she spun a comforting yarn about a charming young dragon, [[Daelius]], she knew of who once outsmarted a [[Devils|Devil]]. The Devil offered all sorts of riches and the [[Wyrmling]] took the deal, secretly changing part of the contract. Instead of giving up his soul, he gave up his sole, living happily ever after, satisfied with his hoard. Evryn commented that he'd heard stories similar to that, but the pun was something he hadn't heard before, and that he found it funny.

[[Burney]] cautioned Evryn against making any deals with Devils. She then showed Evryn her work, a waterfall circlet style braid. "Fresh," Ilsa-vyx described it.

After a bit more conversation Burney asked Evryn if he had a good soul.

"Yeah," he answered, "I suppose I do."

Then Burney walked over to a drawer and fetched a [[Soul Coin]]. "Within this coin is the soul of a poor [[Soul-trapped Wyrmling|Wyrmling]] who wasn't as clever as [[Daelius]]. Would you be so kind as to set its soul to rest?"

"Yes, but, why trust me with something like this?"

"Because you told me that you have a good soul."

Kiarin also got a haircut but it wasn't as narratively significant and Evryn summoned some rats with his *Pipes of the Sewers*.
