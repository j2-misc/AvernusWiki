- [[Evryn]]
- [[Ilsa-Vyx]]
- [[Kiarin]]
# Bullets
- The party went to [[The Infernal Rapture]]
- They all signed contracts saying they'd pay for everything they bought when they left (save for Kiarin who forged her own signature somehow)
- Then the party found [[Lulu]] would be their waitress for the evening
	- She seemed to be under the effect of some enchantment magic that made her forget about most everything besides the appetizers she kept recommending
- Ilsa-vyx and Mekhi managed to get the party into the kitchen as per a deal with the chef (which they loopholed their way out of later)
	- Mekhi poisoned the dessert with *dust of sneezing and coughing* he'd acquired from [[Mezhikchen]]'s ([[Session 9, 28 August 2024|Session 9]])
	- Evryn summoned some rats for later
- The show portion of their dinner-and-show began with a chained [[Gargauth]] to be prodded at by a pair of [[Devils]]
- The party caused more chaos even more overtly as their premeditated plans fell into motion and escaped with a number of things:
	- Gargauth
	- Lulu
	- the ire of an [[Erinyes]] whose [[magical brooch]]--which [[Mahadi]]'d used to summon her--Kiarin briefly stole
	- [[The Meat Grinder]]
- Lulu then talked with the party about who they were and asked them to find [[The Sword of Zariel]] at [[the cyst]] in the hopes that it could turn [[Zariel]] good so she could free [[Elturel]]
- Lulu also said they shouldn't trust [[The Hidden Lord]] as it was the shield [[Lord Yashio]] the [[Demon Lord]] bore at [[Idyllglen|the Battle of Idyllglen]]
- The Hidden Lord addressed the allegations, apologizing for not sharing more of his history with the party
	- He said he was in truth a wizard as he'd told them before
	- He said that he wanted them to construct the [[Staff of Power]] because it he believed it was Elturel's best bet but also that it would be able to free him from the prison his soul had been stuck in for over a hundred years
	- He said his real name was Karnivash, and that he was sorry for ever being associated with that demon, even against his will, as his powers were used for evil, but he hoped his powers would be used for good, now that they were in the hands of good people
- Kiarin accepted this easily, the rest of the party were less ready to trust a victim of [[Demons]] than actual [[Demons]] or [[Devils]].
	- Ilsa-vyx asked Kiarin to unattune from the shield and she complied
- Then the party made it back to [[Elturel]]
# Verbose
The party contemplated on how to style themselves before heading to the [[The Infernal Rapture]]. The restaurant's exterior was glamorous, lights dancing around the sign reading *"Mahadi's Infernal Rapture"*. They were greeted by a tiefling hostess and led to the true entrance. After a second, she blinked a few times and handed everyone a scroll of paper, "we need you all to sign a code of conduct."

The scrolls each stated simply, "I will pay for all goods and services purchased at the Infernal Rapture upon exit." The party huddled up quickly to assess. Mekhi noted there was no mention of what would happen if they didn't pay, but regardless the party signed (save for Kiarin who managed to fake it). Afterwards, they all finally entered.

![[Infernal Rapture.png]]

There were platinum statues, and genuine palm trees. Seated around the restaurants were several [[Devils]], but there were also some fellow humanoids. It looked like another adventuring party consisting of a dwarf, elf, human, and gnome. There was also a pair of goliaths, and a third table with a trio of hobgoblins. The remaining tables were occupied by fiends.

There was also a stage toward the center of the restaurant, a pair of curtains drawn to cover it until showtime. They started to plan out how to sow chaos during the show, but then their waitress approached. She was not a humanoid, nor a Devil, but instead a flying little golden elephant. This was [[Lulu]]. She welcomed them and asked if she could get them anything to drink.

"Uh, one second," and the party quickly huddled up again. They nominated Evryn to ask Lulu some questions.

"We know who you are. How did you end up working here?"

"Mister [[Mahadi]] gave me a job here, and it's a good place to work, it's nice here," Lulu answered.

"Does [[Zariel]] know you work here?"

"Oh, well Mister Mahadi has been very nice to me. There's no problem," she deflected.

Kiarin reached into Lulu's thoughts, but all she could sense she was thinking about was plugging the store's damn goods and services. Evryn attempted to steer Lulu to think about anything else. He tried to get her to play a getting-to-know-you game.

"Oh! I'll go first!" Lulu said. "What appetizer would you like?" She then went on to recommend the [[Stirge]] Sliders.

Kiarin asked her about the show and she wanted to keep it a surprise, per Mister Mahadi's wishes, but her surface thoughts indicated it was something exciting and violent.

Evryn asked what Lulu'd done since she came to [[Avernus]] but her thoughts drew a total blank; absolutely no thoughts entered her mind. Perhaps she was enchanted.

Eventually, the appetizers were brought out and main course orders were taken. Then, Lulu mentioned the chef was willing to speak with them when their meals were brought out, to make some deal in order to see the kitchen.

While the party ate, they drafted a contract to make with the chef. Ilsa-vyx was surprisingly good at contract drafting. Soon enough the chef helped Lulu set plates and approached the party. The gist of the contract was that the party would get a tour (including the inspection of kitchenware) in exchange for a generous reward, and if they were impressed they would provide a great reward. In order to sweeten the deal and secure their visit to the kitchen, Ilsa-vyx offered some spice from her spice pouch. In the end, they managed to get the chef's ([[Jeff]]) signature.

Ilsa-vyx and Mekhi then inspected the kitchen and spiked the desserts being prepared with the Dust of Sneezing and Choking. At the same time, Evryn sneakily summoned some rats with his instrument of rat calling.

At the end of the tour, Jeff asked for his reward and the party said they'd talk about how to reward him as the kitchen was far louder than expected. Evryn managed to deflect somewhat by paying him twenty gold in the meantime for his trouble. At that moment, the chefs began to notice some of the rats, allowing the party to slink back to the table, where Lulu was idling.
## Showtime
Towards the end of the meal, [[Mahadi]] approached the stage and drew everyone's attention. "I offer you a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle, of pure combat, of triumph over evil. Tonight you'll see two brave legates stand against a powerful [[Demons|Demon]]. Now behold! The show of a lifetime!"

The curtains were drawn back, revealing two devils wielding glaives and the posturing of soldiers. Then, dragged out by a [[Chain Devil]] was not just a normal Demon, but [[Gargauth]]. The dessert was served and people began to cough, drawing some attention away from the stage, and at the same time Evryn had some rats flee the kitchen (which at this point was at war with the rodents) and bite at the Chain Devil's shoes, allowing Kiarin to loosen the chains enough to let Gargauth free himself. He immediately grabbed one of the warriors and crushed his skull.

Quickly then, Mekhi tossed something coated in sovereign glue to Mahadi, feigning allegiance and preventing him from casting spells by binding his hands, before Ilsa-vyx dove into the fray and drove her **Fiend Flendser** into one of the Dee-vils. Evryn tried to charm [[Lulu]] in order to coax her into escaping with the party, but was unsuccessful. However, Kiarin was able to confirm that Lulu was independently affected by some enchantment magic, as well as Gargauth; Mahadi, illusion.

At that moment, Mahadi summoned a new fiend that resembled a fallen angel. Mekhi then grabbed Lulu and began fleeing. Evryn followed shortly after, and Kiarin lagged behind only to steal the [[magical brooch]] Mahadi which the [[Erinyes]] didn't seem to appreciate. It flew at Kiarin, demanding the brooch and when she refused, it slashed at her three times, missing each in an attempt to not damage the emerald brooch.

Lulu cried out to Mekhi, "I can't see Mister Mahadi! You have to take me back!" Everyone flooded out, Evryn attempted to put Lulu to sleep, but it failed, though Kiarin was able to dispel the enchantment on her with some amount of ease (possibly due to their distance from Mahadi). Then the Erinyes again tried to take the brooch by force, but by the will of [[The Hidden Lord]] (and a lot of luck), she failed. Mekhi and Gargauth then took off for [[The Tormentor]], but they saw a newly gilded, catapult-equipped [[The Meat Grinder|Meat Grinder]], full of undead. 

This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Mekhi shoulder checked the skeletal driver, placed one hand on the wheel, another in the engine. The monster revved up, he called out to Gargauth to take the party's [[Infernal War Machine]] and Lulu, though she protested travelling with a Demon. The party, plus Lulu piled into the Meat Grinder, but a [[Wight]] Champion (presumably of [[The Golden Doom]]) opposed them! Ilsa-vyx managed to evict the Wight from the vehicle and Kiarin discarded the brooch on it for the Erinyes to collect. She looked at the party (Kiarin) with a look of anger and relief.
## So who are you guys?
[[Lulu]] asked who the party was, breaking up an argument between Kiarin and Mekhi. Ilsa-vyx explained that they were working for the [[Hellriders]], and that she and Evryn belonged to the faction. "You're a Hellrider and you're from [[Elturel]]-" Lulu started, "how much time has passed?"

> As a reminder for readers at home, the [[Idyllglen|Battle of Idyllglen]] occurred around 140 years ago in 1354. The current year being 1494.

Then Lulu explained what she remembered. She was sent to complete some task by [[Olanthius]], she saw [[Mahadi]], and the rest was a blur.

The party then explained that Elturel was still standing (technically; more like floating), but that it was there with them in [[Avernus]]. They explained how [[Zariel]] dragged it there.

"I can't believe it! Zariel wouldn't do that, she fought for [[Elturel|Elturgard]]!" After a moment she continued, "are there more of you? Have you found others?"

Mekhi explained, somewhat unceremoniously, that they found and killed [[Haruman]], and that they found [[Jander]] but he was a [[Vampire]] (though that wasn't different).

Lulu was on the verge of tears, entirely overwhelmed learning most of her friends turned super evil. Though she did offer to tell them where Olanthius and [[Lady Yael]] were. Olanthius was presumably still at [[the crypt]] to the southwest; Yael, [[the cyst]].

Olanthius and his soldiers supposedly built the crypt to seal themselves away as to not turn like [[Haruman]]. Olanthius sent Lulu to see if she could find a way to get everyone out, but that was when she was captured by Mahadi.

However, before she told them more about Lady Yael's whereabouts, she asked them to swear they wouldn't harm Zariel. "I know deep down there's a spark of good in her heart and I think there's something down in the cyst that can remind her of it," Lulu said, "Can you promise me that if I tell you where Lady Yael is, you'll do what you can to save Zariel?"

The party begrudgingly agreed.

"When Zariel led the charge into [[Baator|Hell]], we tried as best we could but the [[Demons]] overpowered us. In the end, Lady Yael told me that she'd taken [[The Sword of Zariel]], which she'd entrusted to her for safekeeping. Yael told me that if there was still a spark of goodness in Zariel when all was done, we must return to her at the cyst. Then she set off, she ran for this mountain. I don't know if she lives, or what became of her, but I think that the sword may be Zariel's salvation. If there's any chance that Lady Yael and that sword may still be in there... you must take that chance, I beg of you."

"Is the sword her source of power?"

"Yes, her sword was imbued with a powerful spark of her own divinity. It is truly a power beyond that of any mortal weapon. I think if she sees that, she might recognize the person she was and choose to be good once again."

Kiarin raised the concern that Zariel might just not turn good again and they might just be handing an incredibly powerful sword to an already incredibly powerful enemy. Lulu looked troubled but she truly believed there was a chance that Zariel could be saved. "The journey will be hard. I don't know of what dangers lie in the cyst, and Zariel will not welcome us with open arms, but I think it's worth doing. If you need more strength or aid, you should seek the crypt of Olanthius and his Hellriders."

Kiarin suggested getting the pieces of the [[Staff of Power]] first and then using the sword and Zariel's redemption as a backup plan. When she referenced The Hidden Lord, Mekhi realized that it was attempting (and failing) to hide behind Kiarin. Lulu then identified it as the shield of [[Lord Yashio]], the [[Demon Lord]], whom the Hellriders fought at [[Idyllglen|The Battle of Idyllglen]].

The Hidden Lord addressed the allegations, "I'm sorry I did not tell you, but I thought that if I did there would be no outcome where you would take me with you. What I have told you is true, I am a mage trapped in this shield, and I was trapped by the Demon Lord Yashio. Upon his demise, I remained in Hell, tossed and strewn about for one-hundred and fifty years until I was found by those cultists and then by you. It is still my desire to help you, and to lift Elturel out of hell. But it is also my desire to be freed from this prison. I believe that the staff of power can not only save the city, but can free me from this shield. That is why I have been so insistent that you reform the Staff of Power. If you reform it, and show mercy to me by freeing me from my curse, we can work together and save the city."

Kiarin said that he hadn't done himself any favors by introducing himself as the Hidden Lord, and she asked if he'd had a name before that.

"Yes. [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]]," he said. "I'm sorry I've hidden so much from you four. I thought I did what was best for us all, but I will learn to work better with you four and entrust you with more information. In turn I will redouble my efforts to provide aid. And Lulu," he started, "I'm sorry for being associated with that filthy Demon, but I was powerless and he used my power for evil. But now I'm in the hands of people who can do good, so I hope to do good."

Kiarin argued insistently in Karnivash's favor insisting he was a victim of circumstance no different from any of the poor souls trapped in coins they'd found thus far, and Evryn seemed at least somewhat receptive, but Mekhi was insistent and Ilsa-vyx went so far as to ask Kiarin to unattune from The Hidden Lord and suggested the party sleep on it.
## Checking out the Meat Grinder
The party found some loot investigating around the vehicle, and headed up to [[Elturel]].

> 64 platinum pieces, a [[Soul Coin]], levitate+ (double weight max, double speed)

It took a few trips, but the party (mostly [[Gargauth]]) managed to get both cars, the whole party AND the big car up to the floating city. Down below, the battle raged on, with [[Shummrath]] leading the [[Demons]] and securely gaining a foothold. As a result, their ascent was unbothered.
