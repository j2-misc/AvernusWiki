# Verbose
The party drove to the [[Lake of Slime|Pit]] of [[Shummrath]]. It was filled to the brim with dark green slime. The party split to affix three [[Boomsticks]] on either side. Both halves of the party ignited their respective fuses and explosions began to rock the canyon as the boomsticks went off, causing debris to hurdle to the stream below.

Before the last charge was ignited, however, a [[Raragin|white, spined devil]] accompanied by two more covered in crusted, grotesque [[Barbed Devils|barbs]]. They landed on the side with Evryn, Mekhi, and [[The Tormentor]]. They commanded, "Stop!"

"Oh yeah?" Mekhi asked, "what's your deal?"

"My master commands you to explain yourselves. Who are you four and why do you roam these planes?"

Mekhi muttered a string of complaints to Evryn.

"Answer my question!"

"I dunno, what does it look like, smarty?"

"If you don't, you'll find that like my master I have little patience."

"Who's your master?"

"[[Zariel]]."

Then a combat broke out. [[Raragin]], the white devil, commented something or other about its suspicion of the party from when it saw them at [[Haruman's Hill]] ([[Session 11, 11 September 2024|Session 11]]). This fell on deaf ears as Ilsa-vyx knocked the two lesser devils into the [[Lake of Slime]]. THankfully, the party was able to drive the devils off and at that moment, [[Shummrath]] reformed from the lake.

He leapt up and swallowed one of the [[Barbed Devils]] whole, and [[Raragin]] kept pace fleeing. Mekhi quickly downed a potion to restore some of his magic and cast *tongues* so he could understand the thing before them.

"I didn't think fleshlings like you would be my rescuers. But I am ready to return to the fields of battle!"

They pointed him in the direction of the fleeing fiends, said something vaguely in Kiarin's direction, which Mekhi could understand as "Thank you, [[Lord Yashio]]" before burrowing away.

Before they left, Kiarin spied and collected a fragment of the [[Staff of Power]], the base.

[[The Hidden Lord]] told Kiarin that he could lead the party to the remaining pieces when they were ready, though they would be more challenging to obtain. He said that he'd rather they go after the piece hidden away in a flying tower before the third.
## Levistus's Emissary
The party returned to [[Levistus's Emissary]], guided again by the same [[Ice Devil]] as before. They met with [[Levistus]] and he offered them step forward and receive the boon they'd earned. An orb of turquoise light floated down to bestow new power upon them.

They were necromantic in nature, but no one could immediately discern more than that. Ilsa-vyx was the only one who refused the boon.

Levistus asked, "Why the hesitation?"

"There is no hesitation," Ilsa-vyx declared. Then she explained that it was unwise to accept the aid of an [[Archdevil]]. "The oath Ilsa-vyx swore upon accepting this station needs not the help of any of yours. It is just business."

Levistus suggested that her refusing the power might be what prevents her from freeing [[Elturel]]. Ilsa-vyx was certain, though. Then, Levistus offered whatever the party, or specifically Evryn could want in exchange for a favor, but they didn't want anything in particular. Sounding somewhat disappointed, Levistus gave the party an icy stone which they could use to contact him.

"Oh, and Strongwind," Levistus said, "if you want to know what happened to your mother, let me know and we can work out a deal."

Ilsa-vyx asked if she could have that instead of a boon, but the offer was refused. They'd have to broker a new deal. Afterwards, they decided to head back to [[Elturel]], as it'd been a while and they'd need to rest soon anyways.
## On the way back to Elturel...
They saw that [[The Styx]]'s flow had diverted by over a hundred feet, potentially revealing a new path. They continued on toward [[Elturel]].

Ilsa-vyx received a sending from [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]], to whom she gave a brief status report. Afterwards, Ramius said that they likely wouldn't be able to return to Elturel, but he asked if they found any [[Hellriders]]. She replied, informing him of the events that took place on [[Haruman's Hill]], specifically regarding [[Jander]] and his [[Vampire|condition]]. She received a final sending from Ramius informing her that they hadn't seen [[Gargauth]] in some time. Ilsa-vyx gave a final response in which she talked about [[The Hells' Exiles]] and the lead they gave the party, that [[Lulu]] was at [[The Wandering Emporium]].
## So they changed course...
They needed to cross [[The Styx]] to get to [[The Wandering Emporium]]. They had to wait for [[Koh Tam|The Ferryman]]. It seemed for a while that no one was going to show up, but then a barge pushed upstream. At first it appeared as a simple wooden sailboat, but the closer it got the more it seemed. The figure operating the barge was none other than [[Koh Tam]]. He was not alone, though, accompanied by a [[Rinne|tiefling]] passenger with icy daggers.

They asked the cost of the transport and apparently all it cost was a story from each passenger along the ride. "Given what we last talked about," Koh Tam said, "you must have many stories to share." After asking permission he shrunk [[The Tormentor]] to the size of a toy and placed it on the barge.

"Has this always been your job?"

"I have a knack for knowing when people need transportation, and this is a lucrative business."

The party rested first, and they'd tell stories as payment after. However, Kiarin introduced herself to [[Rinne]]. She seemed to keep her guard up the whole interaction and offered her services as a mercenary. She kept her gaze suspiciously on Kiarin as she met back up with the party, which Ilsa-vyx and Mekhi attributed to a romantical interest.

Mekhi then tried to squeeze an eye around the barge to look where eyes weren't welcome, to little success, though.
