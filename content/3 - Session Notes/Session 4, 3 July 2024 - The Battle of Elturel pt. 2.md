# Verbose
Ilsa-vyx spoke with a fellow [[Hellriders|Hellrider]], Geoff. He told her that shortly after the city fell, on his patrol east of the cemetery in Westerly, he saw the dead walk. When asked he stated that he passed by the Dancing Horse on his patrol where he saw people boarding up to barricade themselves in.

Evryn asked [[Ramius Dangremond|Ramius]] if he had any spare studded leather armor, and he was offered some free of charge. However, he was then brought to a separate room with a pipe organ. He asked if Evryn would be willing to play it to boost morale. He agreed, but as he sat down to play, they heard a war horn. Ramius told him that if he attuned to the organ he could do more than just raise metaphorical spirits. The horn blared a second time and he warned of another fight before darting away, spreading the word through the hall.

Mekhi took a look outside and saw all manner of fiends–majority cambions. Ilsa-vyx surveyed the area as well and noticed that attached to the city was a giant crimson chain in a recently formed chasm near High Hall. A single link was the size of a house. She saw a knight mounted on a dark steed leading the fiendish charge. They wore a two-handed claymore with luminous orange lines and she couldn’t find a trace of the knight’s body underneath their dark steel armor.

[[The Hidden Lord]] identified the figure as a [[Narzugon]], a fearsome knight atop a Nightmare steed. “Best to avoid that.” Kiarin suggested fleeing, and Ilsa-vyx added that they could likely take shelter in one of Ali’s warehouses in the [[Dragoneye Docks]]. Evryn was resolved to stay, as was Mekhi, and Ilsa-vyx, so Kiarin was too by popular vote.

The fiends attacked, the Narzugon Knight screaming in a booming voice, “Spare no Hellrider!”

During the fight, Evryn activated the pipe organ, magically inspiring all allies on the battlefield! High Rider Ramius was almost slain by the Narzugon [[Haruman]], but managed to stay standing after a volley of attacks that would surely have killed anyone else on the battlefield. Ilsa-vyx then charged and slammed into the knight, knocking him off his steed and nearly thirty feet away. He was then slain quickly after by a lucky shot from Kiarin that knocked him over leaving him open for Ilsa-vyx to render him nonexistent.

They managed to repel most of the fiendish force, but as they fled they fired a volley of parting shots. “Routed them for now,” said Ramius, “I don’t know for how long but that’ll keep them for now.”

Evryn recalled the name Haruman as part of his [[Tale of the Avenger]]. It was the name of one of Zariel’s generals. Ilsa-vyx picked up a locket from the body and brought it to Evryn. Inside the locket was a drawing of a woman with turquoise hair and a blindfold over her eyes.

Surveying the area revealed there didn’t appear to be any fiends in the immediate district. Further north, however, there was another chain past the stream. There was a figure almost akin to a gargoyle with dark green cactus-colored skin, stony wings, and a large imposing presence. He wore a bloodstained breastplate, and instead of moving further into the city, he was standing guard. Some bearded devils tried climbing up the chain and he knocked them off letting out a boisterous laugh.

Afterwards, the party discussed what to do. During this conversation, Ilsa-vyx seemed a little out of it, staring at the ground with a frown. Mekhi offered her the claymore, which seemed to sort of snap her out of it for a second.

Then, they all rested.
## Mekhi
During some downtime, Mekhi located an apprentice mage who identified the claymore and the plate. The claymore was apparently a Hellfire weapon, which would damn souls slain to rebirth as a lemure from the River Styx. Additionally, in place of an attack it had some additional magics relating to charm. The armor was plate mail which provided resistance to acid damage.

Additionally, he received a message from [[The Collector]]. “Mekhi. How goes your mission?”

“Oh, uh, boss. Things are going… fine, I guess. But I am in hell. So is all of [[Elturel]]. Kiarin’s here as well.”

“Hm. Quite troublesome.”

“Would you still consider the job complete or…?”

“I’d say more so in progress. Believe it or not there are some opportunities here.”

“What kind?”  
“Opportunities for… personal advancement. Should you continue to keep my instructions, you’ll find such achievements just at your fingertips.”

“Guess that means job’s still ongoing, we have to protect that guy? Get him out of hell or just safe in the city?”

“I’d like you to do two things. First keep an eye on people you come into contact with–especially Kiarin. Make sure everyone stays cooperative. Secondly,” after confirming the success of Kiarin’s mission with the capture of the Hidden Lord and confirming ominously that it wasn’t cursed, “I’d like you to ensure the shield stays safe.” He confirmed that Mekhi was still interested in employment. The situation prevented him from saying no.
## Kiarin
Kiarin spoke with the Hidden Lord. He assured her that he would do what he could to keep the party safe, and could provide more magic if attuned to. She refused for the time being, and sought out Zythan. The High Rider later confirmed that he was unaccounted for, and he was likely somewhere in Westerly, as he was asked to investigate the area by Ramius. He mentioned he was planning on asking them to investigate the area later that day. After her conversation with Ramius, Kiarin returned to the party and attuned to the Hidden Lord. “It will be good for you to draw upon my magic. Fiends, thankfully, are not particularly resistant to charms. It can get you out of a difficult situation.”
## Ilsa-vyx & Evryn
Ilsa-vyx dreamed of a world where no one could hear her no matter how loud she screamed, and no one could see her no matter what she did. When she awoke she wrote down the dream in her journal.

Evryn was left with mere fragments of his dream. He recalled standing by a man in plate armor shouting something but he couldn’t hear the words. There was a large winged figure near the end, though he couldn’t remember much more.

Once the two were awake, Ilsa-vyx–who’d been awake longer–prepared some coffee. She presented the locket and said that, despite Evryn not knowing who the figure was, if he could sense that there was some story with the woman. Evryn wildly speculated that the woman was Haruman’s former secret lover or something, though he didn’t think she had the air of someone who’d be in hell. “It’s some sort of like… tragic love story or something,” he guessed, “we’ll never know.”
## Meeting with Ramius
Once everyone was up and about, they met with Ramius who personally thanked the party for standing in the defense of High Hall. “If it weren’t for you four, I wouldn’t have walked away alive. I want to give you four an update regarding the state of the city and ask you for another favor.” He said that he’d surveyed the chain. Good news: the devils had stopped climbing the chains en masse. Bad news: the devils were still down there, in battle with other devils, demons, maybe something else. Nothing anyone was in the mood to confront. The city was as safe as it could be whilst in hell. Additionally, [[Zythan Avhoste|Zythan]] was in [[Westerly]] sent before the fall to investigate cult activity. There were also rumors of undead in the area. He wanted the party to be a part of the Hellrider offensive in Westerly. They would set out as soon as possible.

The Hellriders set out in organized patrols toward Westerly, and the party set out on their own toward [[The Grand Cemetery]]. Along the way, they heard a loud yelling. This was the same sound Kiarin heard when she surveyed the area the day prior, and Ilsa-vyx was able to confirm it. Unfortunately, the gargoyle spotted her and she tried to hide, but her ears were too comically large to properly take cover behind the chimney. 

![[Gargauth.png]]

They had a little bit of a tense conversation. The gargoyle said his name was "[[Gargauth|Gargauth the Gentle]]," and they exchanged niceties. However, since Ilsa-vyx was green–like Gargauth and unlike the deevils he liked to kill–he didn’t seem intent on hurting her. From a distance, however, this looked like an immediate threat, so Kiarin recalled her broom of flying with Ilsa-vyx on it. He didn’t pursue and perhaps felt sad at having a new friend taken away from him.

Ilsa-vyx returned to Gargauth while Kiarin and Mekhi were arguing and told him that she needed to kill some undead things, but she’d come back later. “Oh just one minute! Just kick one deevil off cliff! It’s really fun! Trust Gargauth!” Cut back to the rest of the party who–besides Evryn who was notified ahead of time–didn’t notice Ilsa-vyx’s absence. She then convinced them to come back with her to hang out with Gargauth for a minute and kick some devils. Kiarin was too distracted by one of Ilsa-vyx’s pamphlets on the ontological evil nature of fiends to really notice the interaction.

Eventually, the whole party did kick some deevils. Gargauth even was interested in joining the party for their quest if they’d have him. Mekhi was highly in favor of the idea. Ilsa-vyx asked him where he was from. He wasn’t entirely sure what or where Elturel was, but he did mention Koh Tam, who he said was very friendly. Ultimately they decided not to take him with them, since who else would kick deevils.

Afterwards, they ventured through Westerly–the same district as [[The Dancing Horse]]–toward [[The Grand Cemetery]].

At the cemetery, they saw Hellriders in organized patrols pushing successfully against droves of skeletons. The brass gate surrounding the cemetery grounds was out of place, from the earthquake that accompanied the fall. The grass had withered; flowers, wilted and a grand chapel with shattered windows sat in the center. Columns resembling heroes of the past decorated the way forward, into danger.
