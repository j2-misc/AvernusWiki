# Verbose
Headed back to the High Rise, post-encounter with the zombies outside of the catacombs we were hiding in. Speaking to the High Rider, we showed Ramius that we recovered the Helm of Torm as well as Zythan. Helm was mentioned to be invaluable given that there aren't a lot of options right now. Some of the acolytes were given places to commune with Torm, High Rider Ramius giving us first chance to speak or attempt communion given the work the party put in. Some speaking did get done about Gargauth, Mekhi and Ilsa-Vyx conversing about whether or not to share but deciding to eventually do so. They ended up speaking with the High-Rider, who took the news in stride and sent off the party to rest.

Between resting, Ilsa-Vyx attempted to find more details on how food works in the Nine Hells, to little avail. Her and Mekhi spoke, during which Kiarin was able to exchange words with the Hidden Lord regarding more information on cooking or fixing food which he did have some advice on. Mekhi and Ilsa-Vyx went into bickering regarding the circumstances which Evryn spoke to the Acolyte trapped in the Soul Coin during. He inquired on her request once more, to which she gave a little advice and talked about her own background coming from Daggerford. 

The party partook in the ritual. Evryn donned the helm and after asking a question, they were no longer in the ritual room. They felt people race on horseback to an amphitheater housing all manner of people. A number of figures drew to the center, all wearing symbols of twin suns. 

[[Haruman]] was among them, standing eagerly and forthright.

The second was a more taciturn figure, bearing a two-headed bident.
![[Olanthius.png]]

The third was a towering woman with a calming smile, longsword at her side, shield at her back, waving to the crowd.
![[LadyYael.png]]

Next was a nervous-looking man carrying a banner with a shield and spear.
![[Jander.png]]

The fifth was not humanoid, instead a bright yellow mammoth
![[Lulu.png]]

And finally, the sixth, and angel with cerulean wings, a triangular halo, and a lily-colored dress. She wore a silken blindfold and an emerald sword.
![[Zariel.png]]

Haruman was the first to speak, saying that they were [[Zariel]]’s five generals, “we are here to introduce ourselves and state our vows clearly and publicly so you may know that we are here to serve you, to defend you, to protect you even if it takes our dying breath. I am the Knight [[Haruman]].”

The taciturn man, “I am [[Olanthius]]. I vow to protect [[Idyllglen]] with my life.”

The imposing woman, “I am [[Lady Yael]]. It is an honor and a pleasure to serve Zariel as one of her five generals. I hope that you would feel safe with our protection.”

The nervous man, “I’m [[Jander]]. I’m glad to be here.”

The elephantine creature, cheerily tooted her horn, “And I’m [[Lulu]]! I’m basically Zariel’s best friend :) You can count on me to do what’s right! :3”

Finally, Zariel spoke. Not the Zariel the party heard speak before the city was plunged into hell, but an angelic being with a gentle, authoritative aura. “As my generals have proclaimed, we all shall defend Idyllglen, that it and our burgeoning nation should suffer no hardship. And should any threaten us, we will cut them down. I assure you this on my honor as an angel.”

Evryn considered the name, [[Idyllglen]]. He couldn’t recall exactly where or what it was, but he did spot a familiar face in the crowd. He recognized her based on the way she dressed and her demeanor, and though he’d never seen her present herself as a warrior, he saw [[Celosia|his mother]].

Mekhi then took the opportunity to shout out to Zariel. All eyes fell on him and he said, “Wasn’t really cool of you to send Elturel to hell… could you, um, reverse that? … Please?” He drew a number of confused expressions, but the scene changed.

Before they could see they could hear the sounds of battle, and when the light returned to their eyes they found themselves riding through the remnants of a village. Zariel’s army clashed with a horde of demons. In the distance, Zariel and Lulu made battle with a dark demonic figure with batlike wings. Despite wielding incredible might, Zariel’s forces seemed in dire need of help. Kiarin and Mekhi wanted to leave, but Evryn and Ilsa-vyx charged in anyways.

Evryn recalled this story, and he called out to the generals to not follow, “You’re not going to win!”

Jander was the only one who responded, “Save me from that cursed hill, and I beg of you help me atone for my sins,” before continuing to charge. A monkey-like demon then leapt at Yael and grabbed ahold of her, dragging her off her horse and into a portal. Zariel finally removed her blindfold, her eyes glowing white, “Charge forth, brave knights! We shall not permit these demons leave with their lives and one of our own!”

Haruman beckoned them as well and after a moment, the knights continued forward. Then, a voice from nowhere called out, *“Adventurers, heed my words:* 

> *To save thy city of [[Elturel]]*
> *Thou must traverse this plane of [[Avernus|Hell]]*
> *These missions three are key to save*
> *The innocent from hellish graves*
> *Break the chains that bind and clasp*
> *Thine tethered souls to [[Zariel]]’s grasp*
> *Shatter that once glowing light*
> *Which crackles dark like foulest night*
> *Wrench the pact from clenched jaws*
> *And render null the debtor’s clause*
> *By thy blades or by thy words*
> *Thy city’s hope shall rest assured”*

Afterwards, the party found themselves again in the ritual room. Ramius asked them all if they would free the city. It was more than anyone should ever be asked, but Ramius was desperate; the people of Elturel even more so. The party all agreed.

Ramius offered a lead, a cleric, [[Koh Tam]], who would be able to provide information about the hells. Then, Zythan spoke up, “I am a simple diviner, but I know avernus contains all sorts of powerful beings, all who might even oppose Zariel. When you work in politics, you recognize that everyone has enemies, and a person as powerful as Zariel certainly has many. When I was in captivity, I overheard Gideon mention the Wandering Emporium, a center of commerce and activity. In my opinion that place is as good as any to find allies.”

After some deliberation, they decided to speak with [[Gargauth]] about their leads after a rest. Before that, the Hidden Lord said that he had previously looked into creating a Staff of Power, and if the party collected some pieces they could assemble the staff, free him, and free the city.
## During the rest…
[[The Hidden Lord]] told Kiarin she got cursed by reading the Zariel book earlier, and to watch out for any strong violent urges. That night she had a dream where she felt a strong violent urge, but resisted. After she awoke, the Hidden Lord told her the curse had subsided.

The Hidden Lord also spoke to Mekhi! “I believe we’ve gotten on the wrong terms, and I wish to remedy that.”

“Is there any way you can speak with your mouth?”

“I don’t have a mouth in this form, but I can speak aloud. I just don’t want to awaken your companions. I’ve taken notice of your magic, the power you infuse into your strikes, the alterations to your body. I believe I’m familiar with the source of your magic. The Collector, I believe?”

“... That is my boss. Why? Did you know him?”

“Yes. He was a close friend of mine. Assisting me is the same as assisting him.” He went on to ask him to not insinuate that he was cursed. Mekhi pushed back on this somewhat and the conversation soon ended.
## The next morning
[[Ramius Dangremond|Ramius]] reported that [[Zythan Avhoste|Zythan]] located both the [[The Wandering Emporium]] and [[Koh Tam]], who currently resided at [[Fort Knucklebones]]. After some discussion and Ramius mentioning that the food stores would likely last the city a few weeks, the party seemed to agree that information was most valuable, to Zythan’s disappointment. Ramius then gave each member of the party 50 platinum pieces
## Before leaving Elturel
Kiarin asked Zythan to identify any curses on her. He didn’t find any, but he found that the attunement to the shield was more like a growing organism than a typical magical item. He also mentioned he successfully transmitted a message outside the hells to a colleague of his, and that she and some others would be looking into breaking Elturel out from the other side.

Evryn made good on his word and buried the bodies at the cemetery. He received some help from some semi-translucent allies. They later introduced themselves as [[Lania]], Old Silver, Homestead, and Gretchen. As the dirt covered the coins, their spirits began to fade. Lania said one last thing, “Don’t forget my story.”

“I won’t,” he said, and they hugged, and she was gone.

Then, the party spoke with [[Gargauth]], and Descended into [[Avernus]]
