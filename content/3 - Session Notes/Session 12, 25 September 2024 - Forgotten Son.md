# Verbose
There was a clear resemblance between [[Evryn]] and his mother, [[Celosia]]. She was quite pale with hair that reached just below her shoulders, sharing the same blonde as her son. She was dressed casually, and wore a smile. She rushed forth to hug Evryn, "Evryn I'm so sorry I had to leave you! I'm glad you're here, but why are you here?" she asked.

"It's a bit complicated," Evryn answered.

"Who are your friends?"

[[Mekhi]] asked, "So like, that's like your mom?"

"Yes," Evryn answered.

"Huh. Well. Y'know. Hey. We're just tagging along, really. Sorry you're in hell... um... I mean I guess we are too so," Mekhi fumbled his way through an introduction before shoving [[Kiarin]] and [[Ilsa-vyx]] forward.

"Missus Evryn's Mom," Ilsa-vyx started. "Ilsa-vyx is a [[Hellriders|Hellrider]]. We were with Evryn when he came to hell." Ilsa-vyx then nominated Kiarin to explain why they were all in [[Avernus]], explaining in short [[Elturel#The Descent|Elturel's Descent]]. Ilsa-vyx clarified that [[Zariel]] likely wanted payback for the Hellriders, and that it had something to do with a deal she made with [[Thavius Kreeg]], the now deceased High Overseer.

Celosia asked, "Are you trying to save [[Elturel]]?"

Evryn answered, "We're doing the best we can."

Celosia offered to answer any questions the party had, especially Evryn who immediately asked why she was in Avernus.

"I want you to first know that leaving you was the hardest decision I've ever made," Celosia started. She explained she was part of [[Jander]]'s legion, the one that ran away. She went on to live a successful life, where she met [[Evryn's father]], but she was wracked with a sense of guilt, that she'd left people to die. "[[Torm]] answered my prayers," she said. "He blessed me with a strange sort of magic to redeem souls. I knew at once what I had to do. So I said goodbye to your father and to you and I came back here, and I started forming this group. Almost everyone you see here was a damned soul. A [[Lemure]], as the [[Devils]] call them. They are not that way anymore. I'm sorry that I left you, Evryn. I truly am. I was a terrible mother, and I hope you'll forgive me for doing what I had to do."

"But you left," Evryn said. "You were gone without a trace. I haven't heard from you in... ten years?"

"It breaks my heart that I couldn't send a message to you, but I couldn't let you know what I was doing. I didn't know how to explain myself back then, and by the time I came here I couldn't send a letter back to you anymore."

"And you didn't ever think to take a raincheck for a weekend? Ever acknowledge the existence of your family?"

Her eyes began to water. "I truly am sorry, Evryn."

"So you thought the best way was just disappearing quite literally off the face of the earth?"

"You're young, I... I thought that would be the best. I thought it'd be best if you didn't remember me..."

"I guess I don't remember you. Not really," he said. "I remember your stories. I don't understand why you thought... why you thought just disappearing was the way to go? You didn't even tell my dad what was going on! He didn't know what happened."

"I didn't know how to explain it to him. If I could go back and stop myself from being so foolish, for leaving without a trace I would've. I was a fool, and maybe I still am, but here I'm trying to do something good. I hope that makes up for it."

Evryn looked around slowly, and then back at Celosia. "You're doing a lot of good things for a lot of good people. And I'm proud of you for that." He started to walk off.

"Evryn wait!"

"What."

"Now that you're here maybe I can have a second chance. I can help you, I can help everyone and [[Elturel]]. I can make things right."

"I thought you went back to being a [[Hellriders|Hellrider]], went back to hell, maybe got captured by Zariel, but instead you're [[Exiles' base|here]]?! In this oasis from Zariel?! I wanted to look for you, and to make sure you were ok, and... apparently you were."

"I am ok now that you're here, Evryn. The hole in my heart has been filled," she said quite optimistically.

"I'm happy for you. That makes one of us."

After a pause Celosia said, "You don't have to forgive me, Evryn. I hope that one day you do. I want to make things right, so if there's anything that I can do, just say the word."

There was a long pause before Evryn responded, "In that case, go help Elturel."

Mekhi then took an opportunity to speak, asking if Celosia knew of a way out.

"No, I'm afraid I don't," she answered. "Besides, even if I could find a way out for myself, I won't leave these people behind."

Mekhi asked, "Why'd you even bother raising all these people up in the first place? It's nice down here, but it's not the proper realm."

"You're right, it's no substitute for the world above, but I came down here of the belief that everyone deserves a second chance. No one deserves a life of torture and misery, the kind which permeates all throughout this terrible place," she answered.

Mekhi inquired about who ever set up their whole base, as it must've required a lot of powerful magic, the kind which might help the people of Elturel escape.

"Anyone who had the ability to leave hell has left already. I haven't forced anyone to stay who doesn't want to. Everyone here is here because they want to or they have to. The world out there is terrible. I want to do what I can to prevent Elturel from becoming damned, and I think I might know a way." Before she could explain how, she began to sway and collapsed.

Mekhi checked Celosia, and thankfully she still had a pulse. Quickly then, Evryn shook her to see if she would awake, to no avail. He imbued Celosia with some healing magic, her eyes shot open and she began coughing. [[Hellripper]] ran over to the party, "What's going on?!"
## To Celosia's Room
Quickly, they carried her off to her room where a painting of a young Evryn and his father hanged above her bed. [[Hellripper]] commented that this was the first time she'd collapsed in public. She speculated the collapses might be related to [[Celosia]] using her magic too much. "She's just savin' people," Hellripper explained. "After she does it she gets weak. I didn't take much note of it until she started passing out. Really hope it doesn't become anything too serious."

"Did she heal someone recently?"

"Yes, she goes out pretty often to find any [[Lemure|Lemures]] walkin' about. Finds 'em, brings 'em back here. I'm gonna have to tell her to take it easy. Sorry you had to see that."

Mekhi commented that magic was weird and the party might be unable to help. "This is rough. Feel bad for you guys, or, well her. Guess that's the cost of trying to help people down here."

[[Jander]] entered in a panic, "I saw her fall is she ok?"

"Well she's alive," Mekhi said.

"I don't know," Evryn answered.

Jander asked Celosia what happened, and she said she was fine. Then, she thanked the party for bringing Jander back. He thanked the party for reuniting him with a fond friend. He vowed to the party that he'd take care of Celosia.

Mekhi asked Jander if he could point them in the direction of the other of [[Zariel]]'s Generals ([[Lulu]], [[Lady Yael]], and [[Olanthius]]). Celosia chimed in that she knew where Lulu was, but first insisted the party rest, as they seemed in dire need.

[[Hellripper]] instructed the party they'd feign calm and certainty, then they'd have dinner, and they'd be shown to some sleeping quarters after the fact.
## Dinner
They were all seated in a large dining hall, with over a hundred people. The furniture smelled fresh, for lack of a better word. They were served vegetables and bread, there were also some grapes and some meat. For the most part it tasted like proper food. Only the jerky and other preserved foods tasted of ash.

A nearby child complained about this, like any child on the material plane would complain about vegetables.
## The Dormitory
They were brought to a dormitory, not too much space, but enough for the four of them. Mekhi claimed a bed and Kiarin checked on Evryn who had a sort of thousand-yard stare on his face. She offered to go for a walk and anyone was welcome to join. Evryn took her up on the offer.

Before they left, however, Ilsa-vyx pulled Kiarin aside to try and suggest that she and Evryn might have something in common with regards to strained maternal relationships. While on the subject, Kiarin taught Ilsa-vyx how to swear in elvish.
## A walk to the garden
Kiarin asked Evryn about his father. He was a bit taken aback, having been preoccupied thinking about his mother. He explained [[Evryn's father|his father]] was a bit of a bard, traveling from tavern to tavern sharing stories and magic. "Settled down a bit after they had me. He's the one who actually taught me how to... play some of my instruments."

Kiarin asked if he'd be willing to play something and he decided to play a song his father taught him. A lullaby his dad told him his mother taught, but he couldn't remember her playing. Evryn took out his crescent harp, and he began to pluck a [peaceful melody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yQpU_73Dv0). He continued the conversation, "My dad has a big heart. My mom really liked that about him. So... when she left he really struggled with that." After a pause, "He knew where she was going and that she was going to do some sort of work, but she didn't say anything more than that. I mean I get not telling me, I was seven at the time, but why not tell your husband where you're going to be and then disappear for so long. I mean, if you had someone who was a Hellrider and you hadn't heard from them, what would you assume?"

"Probably that they were riding into hell, which I can't imagine is a comforting thought."

Kiarin began to play along and the conversation continued.

Evryn said that his mother had left without a trace, "and I come and find her in this... place... and she's perfectly fine and saying 'oh I'm so sorry' and she's so apologetic and teary-eyed and she's acting like an apology will just fix it? Cause it's been *years* just wondering where she was, if she's alright and I- I can't even be properly sad or upset at her, because she's apparently overexerting her magic because she's so dang selfless so I can't even be upset at her without looking like an absolute jerk?! It's just unfair!"

Kiarin related to him and explained some of her own history with her mother. "I understand how you feel, I think."

"I appreciate it."

"This is a good song, by the way. You have good taste."

"Well it was my mother's melody. Not exactly *my* taste."

"Well it is now, isn't it?"

"Yeah," Evryn said. "I suppose it is."

(As they returned to the dorm, Kiarin gave Ilsa-vyx a thumbs-up and a nod, and in the night Ilsa-vyx began working on a pamphlet with information on the others of the party to show [[Jade Strongwind|Jade]], if she would ever see her again).
## Interlude
A woman sits atop a crimson metal throne, made from the blades of a thousand fallen foes. A halo above her bald head. She leaned forward to an attentive ebony steed. The woman extended her left arm, a spiked flail uncoiling from it. "What message have you to share, hm?" she demanded from the steed.

The steed bowed its head and spoke when imbued with magic. "I have sensed the presence of four mortals on my [[Haruman's Hill|master's hill]]. They have stolen the [[Jander|vampire traitor]]."

"If they move against me, I shall not spare them my wrath. And for your loyalty," she turned the steed to cinders, before it emerged reborn as though from a cocoon. It was a pale creature with spines along its back, shambling out of the throne room with a purpose.
## A conversation with the Hidden Lord
[[The Hidden Lord]] spoke with [[Kiarin]], noting [[Mekhi]]'s continued mistrust of him. She suggested he not worry about it so much. He also noted that he was skeptical of the party's ability to save [[Elturel]] and escape with the aid of [[The Hells' Exiles]]. He suggested that he knew exactly how they could rescue Elturel and escape [[Avernus]]. "Remember, it was my objective to find the missing pieces of the [[Staff of Power]]. If you follow my advice and put it back together, you'll find yourself back home in a quite timely manner, Elturel alongside you."

He informed Kiarin that there was a piece of the Staff not far to the northwest of the [[Exiles' base]]. "I recall that the piece in the northwest is submerged in a [[Lake of Slime]]. I have not laid eyes upon this lake, but the location of this lake is more remote. It is unlikely you would deal with much danger on the way to the lake, though retrieval might prove a mild challenge. But, I believe in the capabilities of your party. You've kept yourselves alive far better than I have."

After a bit more conversation, during which the Hidden Lord hyped up the party a bit more, the Lord fell silent.
## A knock at the door
[[Evryn]] answered and there was a large figure, [[Patrick]], [[Thiodon]]'s apprentice, who informed the party she needed to talk to the party about their [[Infernal War Machine|vehicle]]. [[Mekhi]] decided to head over and Thiodon said that she needed parts to fix their machine, which she restated somewhat irked when [[Fort Knucklebones]]. Then she suggested a few things:
1. If they were to find another vehicle, the party should bring it back to the [[Exiles' base]] first, and that they should chain it to their car to haul it
2. Be careful of other [[Warlord Gangs|gangs]], as everyone was looking for scrap

When Mekhi returned, [[Kiarin]] informed him about the [[Staff of Power]] and the fact one of its fragments was nearby. First they'd have to be debriefed by [[Celosia]], though.

Evryn changed the subject, asking about [[The Hidden Lord]] and he spoke up for himself explaining that he was traveling to find one of the fragments of the Staff of Power, when he was beset by opportunistic cultists who trapped his soul in a shield. When Mekhi asked, Mister Shield said that he was completely certain the Staff of Power could get the party out of the hells. "Believe me," he said, "I'm not trying to mislead you. I want to escape the hells as badly as you do, and I think the Staff is the best way to do that."

Evryn considered The Hidden Lord's words. He seemed genuine in wanting to leave the hells, but given the stories he'd read, there surely *must* be some reason why he was so insistent on the party being the ones to do it. It felt as though there was something he wasn't telling them. Then, he asked the shield if he specialized in any sort of magic in life.

"I suppose you could find my magic falling vaguely under the war category, blending evocation and abjuration. I never favored one or the other," he clarified.

The party went on a little tangent about wizards they'd met, and the kind of people they were and Mekhi went on for a little longer about the [[Dragoneye Docks]] in its heyday.

Then, they returned to [[Celosia]]'s chambers.
## The debrief
Celosia was lying in bed. She asked the party how they were and if they slept well. They informed her about the [[Staff of Power]] and how they were intent on following up on that lead, but first Celosia had one of her own. She told them that she didn't know what had become of [[Lady Yael]] or [[Olanthius]], but [[Lulu]] was an immortal being and she'd heard of her being spotted at [[The Wandering Emporium]], at a restaurant. She couldn't say exactly where Lady Yael was, and with Olanthius she could only recall [[the battlefield]].

Evryn asked, "Are all of them still themselves?"

"You're right," she answered, "they could be changed like [[Haruman]], they could be dead, they could be imprisoned. Just with [[Jander]] coming back, I have some hope that the other [[Zariel|generals]] are still out there."

Mekhi thanked Celosia for the help on behalf of the party. They began to depart, but Evryn's mother had a few more words for her son, "please, stay safe out there."

"I... will... try my best." Then he paused for a second, turned around and reached into his bag. He walked over to his mother. "I don't know what to say, it is... I've kept it safe for you all these years. Here's your harp back, Mom." Celosia smiled and accepted the instrument.
## After
Kiarin offered Evryn her violin to borrow if he needed it, but he had a fiddle carved by his father, his favorite instrument.

Mekhi went to pick up [[The Tormentor]], where he ran into [[Hellripper]] who was heading out as well. She'd lead the party out of the cave. When Mekhi picked up the car, [[Thiodon]] told him she'd put some chains on it so they could haul scrap around. They headed out and Hellripper warned them to be cautious of [[The River Styx]].

She told them they had a few options to cross The Styx:
1. Wait for the ferryman
2. Try and find a shallow spot, but one drop of the water on one's skin would drive one mad (not recommended)

"I'm not a woman with a lot of faith, but I've got faith in you four."
## Westward
The party headed toward the [[Lake of Slime]]. [[Ilsa-Vyx]] provided the [[Infernal War Machine|fuel]] and they eventually made it to a stretch of [[The River Styx|The River Styx]]. It didn't move in quite the way one would expect. The party contemplated how to get across a shallow bit of The Styx, but Kiarin convinced Mekhi to let her drive them the long, safe way around at the cost of her donating the fuel for their vessel.

Along the way Ilsa-vyx spotted a [[Devils|Devil]] waving them down.

![[Ice Devil.png]]

[[Evryn]] suggested they stop and from a distance call out to them. He shouted out, "Hello, how's it going?"

The fiend called out in broken common, "You... human... not devil...?"

"Yeah?"

"Why... you... drive... here...?"

"Because it's faster than walking, do you need a lift?" This offer caught some of the party by surprise.

The devil explained that his boss could take the party, "a diplomat... this way... [[Levistus]]... he told me... look for people interested in... talking... yes."

Mekhi asked him how far this boss was, and the devil told him that they were on the border of his "talking place", which he was guarding.

Per Evryn's suggestion, Mekhi asked what was in it for them, and he cast *tongues* on himself to understand the Devil's native Infernal tongue. "Levistus sent me here as a guard and a diplomat. He wants to form an alliance with [[Zariel]] who seems to want anything but an alliance with him. I think he'd be open to making some sort of deal with mortals."

"Zariel and Levistus aren't on good terms?"

The devil laughed, "that fool Zariel doesn't want an alliance with anyone. She seems to hate everyone and everything. Might as well try and ally with a [[Demons|Demon]]."

After some deliberation, the party decided to follow the Devil having considered that he might provide them access to some information they wouldn't otherwise have access to, like the locations of more fragments of the [[Staff of Power]].
## Levistus's Emissary
They were led up a mountain to its snow-covered peaks, where they faced a mirror covered in rime. A figure appeared in the mirror, with spiked icy armor and hair slicked back.

![[Levistus.png]]

He didn't speak authoritatively, but rather calmly, "a pleasure to meet you. Please introduce yourselves."

[[Mekhi]] asked why he called them there. Levistus informed them he was the leader of the [[Stygia|Stygian]] Hell of [[Baator]]. "[[Zariel]] has proven to be unreceptive to my offers of allyship. She made quite a gruesome example of my prior diplomat. I've begun to lose my patience with her. I doubt that her or any of her underlings are interested in anything beyond the realm of [[Avernus]], but perhaps you four are. Perhaps you have greater clarity and insight than Zariel does." He asked them why they were here, and Mekhi gave a vague answer but [[Ilsa-Vyx]] told him that Zariel stuck them there and that she's the worst.

The party refrained, however, from telling him exactly what they were looking for at the moment. 

Levistus informed them that he was, "no mere soul thief. I am above that. There are ways we can help each other without you forfeiting your souls, are there not?"

"There are," Mekhi said. "But I don't know how much use a devil like you'd find in gold or whatever."

"A devil like me is quite resourceful. I'd like you to have an open mind going into these talks. You do not need to act so guarded. Really I have no interest in your souls, or lives. In return for a bit of your favor, you can take one step closer to saving your city and yourselves. Do we have an understanding?"

"I understand that. So what are you offering?"

Evryn suggested not informing him they were looking for the staff fragments, but that they lacked knowledge on the whereabouts of Zariel's generals.

Levistus suggested it was highly likely they were still alive, as Zariel would be unlikely to dispose of useful servants. "But why is it you're looking for them?"

Evryn answered, "it's been over a hundred years, we have a lot to be filled in on."

"You seek their counsel?"

"Yes, that's a good way of putting it."

"So why are you in this region of the hells? They are not here."

"Well now we know that," Kiarin chimed in.

The party then had a group huddle, tried to consult [[The Hidden Lord]], who was unresponsive. Then, [[Levistus]] asked about the shield, and the party tried to convince him it was a normal magic shield with zero guys in it. Evryn cast *zone of truth* as though through the shield. Levistus dispelled the effect.

The party then reiterated that they wanted information about Zariel's former generals. Levistus made them a few offers. He could...
1. Equip the party with some help
2. Bestow a boon of resistance upon them
3. or offer a pawn, whose alignment was opposite to Zariel

"And who's this pawn?" Mekhi asked.

"Nearby this [[Levistus's Emissary|Emissary]] is a [[Lake of Slime]]. But the slime is not some harmless substance, but the decomposed slurry of... well... someone who Zariel has wronged. An offshoot stream of [[The River Styx|The River Styx]] is what caused the decomposition, so if you can dam that stream, then you could use the help of the individual. I could help you with that, but what's in it for me? Can I have your goodwill, that we can work in an amicable alliance for the undermining of Zariel's rule?"

Ilsa-vyx asked more about the entity, to which Levistus explained that they'd find an unlikely ally in [[Shummrath]]. Then, when they return to the Emissary, Levistus would grant them a boon of his choosing.

Ilsa-vyx was clear she didn't want them to take any boons from the first evil clawed hand of a devil that wasn't even there in person. They decided to accept the offer, and decide about the boons later. He then offered a contract for them to sign. Kiarin started to read it over, commenting that it was particularly long, and Levistus stated that nothing was in it that they hadn't agreed to.

Ilsa-vyx found a specific clause regarding the boons, stating that the acceptance of the boon necessitates continued partnership, like a Terms of Service document for a free trial that charges your card after the trial ends with nothing you can do about it. Mekhi went to sign it, but Ilsa-vyx stopped him and questioned Levistus about it. Levistus adjusted that clause such that no further alliance was necessary after the transaction and the party all signed, Mekhi first, Kiarin second, Evryn third, and Ilsa-vyx reluctantly put a needlessly large signature.

He granted them a few [[Boomsticks]], and suggested he could temporarily part with a [[Rinne|Tiefling Rogue]] under his employ in exchange for a [[Soul Coin]]. They denied the offer from now, and when asked Levistus refused to provide a copy for now (suspicious), and stated that he was looking forward to working with them more, "Especially you, [[Ilsa-Vyx|Strongwind]]."
