As they descended, the party caught a final glimpse of Elturel before the [[Avernus|Avernan Wastes]] caught their attention. Machines made for war strewn about next to pools of lava. Near the bottom of Elturel’s chains, fiends engaged in endless battle at a permanent stalemate. Then, a number of spined devils, one even nearly as big as [[Gargauth]], gave chase. Thankfully, they were able to land mostly unharmed. Ilsa-vyx asked Gargauth where [[Koh Tam]] was, he didn’t know, but he did ask her to say hi to them for him.

Off in the distance, they could see a rocky formation that even without detail, seemed likely to be their mark, [[Fort Knucklebones]]. Mekhi then revealed he could detach his head from his shoulders in order to get a slightly higher vantage point. This disturbed Ilsa-vyx.

They began the trek over, during which Evryn healed Ilsa-vyx. At this point, the party could hear shouting ahead, the clashing of metal, from within a crater a short jaunt away. Mekhi crawled to the lip of the crater and looked down and saw these metallic vehicles like self-propelled, railless minecarts rushing past each other; undead and devils waging war against each other. In total there were three [[Infernal War Machine|vehicles]], one of which had been toppled over. Ilsa-vyx considered that if the party took the horseless carriage, they might blend in better. When asked, Kiarin donated a bit of extra cloth and a hemp rope to the cause. Mekhi then tied a bit of rope around his forearm, detached it from his body, and tossed it toward the machine. He then, quickly as he could, started hauling [[The Tormentor|the machine]] up.

At this point, someone took notice, a woman–a spellcaster of some kind–who noticed the machine upright and asked for help dealing with the devils. Kiarin (begrudgingly) emerged from stealth to serve at least as a distraction, aided by Evryn’s emotional support while the others hauled up the machine. When Kiarin and Evryn approached, another creature in the other machine spoke, “She’s a necromancer she’ll make corpses of you! Don’t trust her!”

[[Feonor|The woman]] hit a wall and the devil again spoke, smoke billowing in tandem with his words, “If you help me, I’ll make it worth your while! She’ll just use you as another corpse to throw!”

Evryn considered [[Bitterbreath|the devil]]'s offer. There seemed to be at least a kernel of truth to it. The others finished retrieving the machine, and after some debate, the party decided to help the woman, against Evryn’s better judgment. Mekhi quickly dove into the war machine they’d procured, tossing a corpse out of the driver’s seat where he found a warhorn and a pouch containing 4 soul coins. Then, he thrust a lever forward and the machine charged forth into the horde of devils!

During the fight, a lot happened, but perhaps most notably, Ilsa-vyx managed to hijack the devils’ vehicle and take it on such a violent ride all the devils inside it were tossed about, some even flung from the machine entirely.
