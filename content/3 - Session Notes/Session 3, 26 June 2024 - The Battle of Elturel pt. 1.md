The sky was a crimson red, and a wave of heat replaced the cool night breeze carrying the stench of ash and brimstone. People were beginning to stand up. Everyone was afraid. In the distance beneath them were thick clouds of ash and smoke. They were up high. Mekhi was certain they were in [[Avernus|hell]].

Around then, they heard screeches from up high. Descending rapidly, packs of imp-like creatures approached, primed to attack. During the fight, the shield spoke to Kiarin asking her to use it, and when she finally did it animated, moving to protect her with thought alone.

The surrounding crowd cried out cheers of encouragement as Ilsa-vyx destroyed the scout leader. As the fight was closing out, someone showed up and stole one of Mekhi’s kills. Ali was a woman in the prime of her life but thanks to the scar on her face her appearance was marred; Shoulder-length hair with a raven tone, pulled back as to not conceal the nasty scar stretching from one side of the face over a milky white eye. She seemed to know Mekhi as well as Ilsa-vyx. A bell sounded as a call to the High Hall. Ali said she had a safe house for people at the docks, but that the party should heed the summons, and they did.

They made their way to [[Torm's Bridges]], when suddenly a giant crimson meteor crashed into a building to their right. They ran to help the people inside. It was hard to see, but with a quick casting of detect thoughts, four individuals were identified and generally located. There was a dwarven man half stuck in the rubble, and he asked the party to help, “My wife! My kids! We’re trapped in here!” Mekhi was able to get them out, and they gave him a bright orange potion, “It’ll make you much stronger, it should help you.”

The party reunited with [[Hilde & Nullob]] who themselves were accompanied by more civilians. At the southernmost bridge, [[Torm's Bridges|Torm's Blade]], there was a battle between devils and [[Hellriders]], confused civilians trying to flee. The party engaged and saw the bearded devil they slew back in the cult lair. Ilsa-vyx wasted no time throwing him off the bridge and into the chasm below. Evryn recalled a story of good friends, and Kiarin read aloud a blessing written on the bridge, which brought about a latent glow and damaged some of the fiends! The remaining fiends were dealt with swiftly.

They ran over to the northern bridge to take it from the devils as well. There was a woman with batlike wings who–aside from the wings–looked almost like a normal tiefling. She turned to the party and snarled a threat. A fight ensued, during which Ilsa-vyx was rendered unconscious twice. During her unconsciousness she spoke with a mysterious voice who said he’d help her, though he didn’t mention any details. Hilde gifted the party a magical shortbow from her deceased friend, and the party made their way to the High Hall in search of sanctuary and healers.

They approached [[Ramius Dangremond|Ramius]] and reported on everything that happened. They rested.

Kiarin spoke to her shield and learned it was known as [[The Hidden Lord]], and he used to be a noble and magical scholar looking into the Nine Hells. He was ambushed by devils and trapped in the shield. “Through a series of violent exchanges, that maniac found me, brought me to your city, and now I’m back in hell. As to free me from the shield, I believe I know a way if you are willing to help. In exchange I can give you information about the area.” The shield said it had more power than just being a shield. Mekhi was still suspicious, of course.
