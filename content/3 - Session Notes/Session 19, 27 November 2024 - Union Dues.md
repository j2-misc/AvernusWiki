The party drove to [[The Fallen Tower]]. Evryn introduced himself to the [[Soul-trapped Wyrmling]]. Apparently, he had tried to trick an [[Imp]], [[Kupu]], in the same way [[Daelius]] had, but due to a spelling error, he accidentally double-negatived his way into giving away his soul. Mekhi popped into the conversation for a bit and after a bit one of *his* [[Soul Coin|Soul Coins]] started talking to him.

"While you're at it, get me out too," it said. It was the one he'd used to power his spell in the memory ([[Session 18, 20 November 2024 - The Crypt|Session 18]]). Her name was [[Kara]]. She seemed to hold his use of her soul for his magic against him, as apparently it wasn't a particularly fun experience. She also cast the blame on her being a Soul Coin on [[Rinne|her sister]]. She made it clear to Mekhi in no uncertain terms that she, nor any of the other coins liked being used, sold, or even being coins at all. "The least you could do is find my sister," who she explained had made a deal with an [[Archdevil]], against her advice, resulting in her current state.

Evryn noticed that Kara seemed a little intentionally vague. Funnily enough, when she gave a description of her sister, it sounded like [[Rinne]].
## The Fallen Tower
The party saw some large defenses and a machine near the bottom, so they decided to catapult themselves through a window instead. Inside, it seemed picked clean.

In the first room they went to, there were two [[Demons]] in a sweltering forge, one was a [[Gorilla Demon]] stirring a cauldron of molten gold. They seemed to be forging coins.

The coins were being imprinted with the face of a reptilian demon, and a name: [[Aurumvas]]. Kiarin commented that the name was a bit on the nose, and [[The Hidden Lord]] noted that Aurumvas was the [[Aurumvas|Demon Lord of Avarice]]. The party ambushed the monsters and investigated the area after dispatching them.

Picking the lock to the next room, the party saw a creature with a large magnifying glass investigating some sort of egg-shaped thing. To the side there was a music box. When the door opened he squinted at the party with seven of his eyes. He seemed kinda chill, actually, for the most part. He saw that the party had killed the demons in the other room, but wasn't very surprised or upset about it.

He said his name was [[Gorgonash]]. He expressed that he hated working for Aurumvas as all he did now was clerical work, and that he wanted to be killing and eating people like he was supposed to do with intruders like the party. Still, he gave them some time to consider their options. [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]] said that Demons like this fed on soul energy like devils from another world. After some consideration, they convinced him pretty easily to go and kill his boss. He led the way upstairs where they saw eleven demons attending to their master, Aurumvas.

Improbably, the party managed to convince like all of the Demons to kill and eat Aurumvas by making a populist appeal. "Kill and eat him! Kill and eat him!" Mekhi decided that then was a perfect time to become a T-Rex. A combat broke out and the party was quick to act! Notably, while the rest of the party fought valiantly, Kiarin slipped away immediately to search for treasure to steal. Behind the throne room, under a rug, she found a trapped trapdoor but bypassed it skillfully (pure luck) and found a treasure room holding a ring, lyre, a mantle, a *staff fragment*, a bag, a bundle of linens, a puzzle box, a gold chalice, a few potions, a scroll, and just *so much gold*. She set out on her silly little collectathon while the rest of the party was fighting against a [[Demon Lord]].

Things were not looking great for the party, as Aurumvas was incredibly powerful. Thankfully, though, they didn't need to kill him. Kiarin emerged and the party started booking it to the window. *Barely,* the party made it out the window and began falling safely thanks to some magic and continued sprinting away as Aurumvas, winged, pursued.

Evryn cast a potent spell at Aurumvas, crippling one of his limbs; Kiarin, with [[Uldrak]]'s help, launched a rock enshrouded in darkness at him to buy them some valuable seconds. That, plus Mekhi's driving, the party managed to barely escape!
## Examining the loot
The ring was a **Demon Signet Ring**, the lyre was an **Instrument of the Bards**, the mantle was a **Mantle of Spell Resistance**. Other items include a bag of holding, a bundle of rare silks and linens (200 gold), an ivory puzzle box (50 gold), a gold chalice inlaid with rubies (100 gold), 500 gold coins stamped with Aurumvasâ€™ face, a potion of invisibility, 2 potions of Greater Healing and Spell Slot Restoration, and a scroll of Dispel Magic.

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
> While wearing this ring, you have resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks against demons.

Then, Kiarin placed the second fragment of the scroll with the first, and a wave of power seemed to wash over her.
