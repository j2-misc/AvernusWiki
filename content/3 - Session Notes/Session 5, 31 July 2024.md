The party considered how to progress. Ilsa-vyx pointed out some windows through which they could enter the cathedral ahead, beyond a mass of undead. They crept toward the windows and snuck through, finding depictions of religious scenes. Further, there was a storage room housing robes, incense, ritual necessities, and a spiral staircase which descended further. Evryn found three spell scrolls: mass healing word, remove curse, and tongues. As the party was about to descend, they heard footsteps approaching from below, and a rough voice called out, “Who’s there?”

Ilsa-vyx asked, “[[Gargauth]]?”

The figure came into view, a dark skinned man with beads around his neck and waist. He wore gold on his fingers and wrists.

“Who are you four?” He asked. His name was [[Gideon Brightscored]], high priest of the chapel, a worshiper of the Morning Lord, [[Lathander]]. After some back and forth he told them that he didn’t trust them, that they had an aura about them and he asked them at spellpoint to leave. He didn’t seem very concerned about the undead around. This was odd. After a few more evil ass warnings with his evil ass magic, he fired a warning shot at the party and they didn’t take the threat well.

Ilsa-vyx ran past Gideon and discovered a number of people missing pieces of themselves, likely undead. Behind them was [[Zythan Avhoste|Zythan]], bound and gagged. They quickly released him and dealt with the undead, while Gideon said something about how “she” ([[Zariel]]) wouldn’t let him fail, and that he would strike down the party who he claimed were demon worshipers. He said she needed the city and its people, “anything to kill the demons.”

Eventually, Mekhi rendered Gideon unconscious and Zythan said there was no point in letting him live, as he was an undead monster. Ilsa-vyx executed him and they found some strange, crimson-lined coins.

It was a [[Soul Coin]], contained within it was someone’s soul, and they were the primary currency in the Nine Hells of [[Baator]].

Looking around finally, the party assessed they were in a tomb for the cremated, based on the murals on the walls and the general tomb vibe. Ilsa-vyx also found a golden wand on the body of the cultist, coated in evocation magic. He told them that the cultists tried to get him to alter the magic on some magic helm housed in an adjacent room, so they could contact Zariel. He couldn’t, of course, that was the domain of a transmuter rather than a diviner like Zythan.

*They rested.*
## After the rest
Any rations they ate tasted only like ash. Evryn spoke with the soul coins, one in particular seemed aware of its surroundings. “I’m Lania, I’m an acolyte here,” she explained she and her friends used to work at the chapel, but they were caught and killed by Gideon. In lieu of being freed from her prison, she asked Evryn to give a proper burial to the cultists strewn about. Although he couldn’t give them such a burial right away given that there are zombies outside.

Kiarin asked Zythan, “I know you are a diviner and thus not specialized in other forms of magic, but: we don’t have very many other skilled mages in the city as of right now. Do you think it is possible, for you now or with time and with research, transport some number of people out?” Zythan commented that it was possible in the future, but that it would take a great amount of research and effort in order to do such a thing… but he was very uncertain. He commented they should take the Helm with them, to return safely and see if Ramius would have orders for what to do. Kiarin seeing that this was the case, inquired upon transporting a message rather than transporting people. When Zythan confirmed that was possible, Kiarin was suggesting to contact some of Zythan’s contacts within the [[Lords' Alliance]].

From here, there were some brief introductions between Zythan on behalf of Kiarin. Afterwards, Zythan led the party to the next room where they retrieved the Helm of Torm, which supposedly possessed the ability to contact the gods.

Back the way they came and down the side path, they found a living quarters, atop a desk there was a tome, Gideon’s Testament, and Mekhi bullied Kiarin into reading it. It described a series of holy visions, from divinity beyond divinity. It included a transcription of conversations between Gideon and the Woman in White, from whom he was seeking guidance pertaining to the visions he was receiving. He asked a number of theological conversations:

> *G: “Tell me: what is the greatest evil?”*
> *W: “It is that of the Abyss. It is a teeming horde of chaos that seeks to rip down civilization”*
> *G: “And why should civilization not be destroyed?”*
> *W: “It is what gives life meaning, the origin of morality and thought, of art and science.”*

> *Her beauty was so bright it seemed to blind my eyes but… (it continued to describe the woman’s beauty and her fall from grace, wings severed). It’s the gods’ place to stand between man and chaos.*

A final transcript read:
> *G: “But why did you turn from the light”*
> *W: “I turned from the light because it blinded me.”*  
> *G: “Is it not the light that lets us see?”*
> *W: “That is the lie of the light, we think only of what it illuminates, not what it conceals from us.”*

The great blindness, the great lie is that the gods protect man from chaos. They are inactive in the war against chaos. That is why Zariel turned from heaven, because she saw the truth of her holy purpose, to stand between man and chaos. It is hell that fights eternal so mortals can live a few meager years on the material plane.

Kiarin read all that and then got cursed with being a Zariel apologist. The party then decided what to do next and Zythan explained what the Zarielite Wand did (Wand of Guiding Bolts). Then, they exited the chapel to deal with the undead outside.
