# Party
- [[Mekhi]]
- [[Evryn]]
- [[Ilsa-Vyx]]
- [[Kiarin]]
# Bullets
- The party ventured to [[The Crypt of the Hellriders]]
	- During this time, actors elsewhere pursued [[Session 18, 20 November 2024 - The Crypt#Interlude|goals of their own]]
- There they each underwent trials to prove their worthiness
	- Ilsa-vyx's sense of duty was weighed against her sense of right
	- Mekhi's sins were weighed against Evryn's compassion
	- Kiarin's loyalty was tested
- All succeeded and they were transported to a battlefield in the past, where [[Olanthius]] and [[Lady Yael]] fought against [[Shummrath]] who was forced to retreat by a verbose, [[Demons|Demonically]] aligned [[Gargauth]]
- After the fight, the party was chased through the nightmare by a mere dream of [[Asmodeus]] who slew them all effortlessly, but not before Evryn could hear [[Zariel]]'s last words to Lady Yael
- When they all awoke, they were with Olanthius who agreed to travel with them after some convincing, despite his concerns about his supercedent oath to Zariel
- Mekhi and Kiarin spoke privately about [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]], [[The Collector]], and the [[Staff of Power]]
# Verbose
Kiarin talked a bit with [[Uldrak]] about his state and how they'd make his situation a priority. Certainly [[Celosia]] could help, and if that failed, there was likely someone on the Sword Coast who could help. That said, whatever changed him seemed to be at his very core, rather than a typical spell. It must have been some sort of ability unique to [[Archdevil|Archdevils]], but surely it could be reversed with the help of Celosia and [[The Hells' Exiles]].
## Interlude
Two war machines on opposing sides, two devils wielding weapons flanked by lackeys, approach cautiously.

[[Bitterbreath]] on one side approached with a limp, [[Princeps Kovik]] swinging his chains. [[Raragin]] met them in the middle. [[Zariel]] offered amnesty for past transgressions and promotion within [[Devils|Devilish]] ranks. All they asked for was a temporary alliance. If they would raid the [[Exiles' base]] and slay all who lived within they would earn their reward. Neither Kovik nor Bitterbreath were exactly jumping at the offer, but both accepted with a certain resolve.

Away from the [[Warlord Gangs|Warlords]], Raragin spoke with his Superior. She was pleased with his usefulness, and told him to prepare for another conflict with the persons of interest. "And this time, bring more competent help."
## The Crypt
The party approached the door. It lacked handles or any obvious way to open it, but soon after touching it two spectral knights emerged. "Why do mortals such as you seek to enter [[The Crypt of the Hellriders]]?"

They explained they were here to help, sent by [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]] to sort out the whole [[Zariel]] situation. Specifically they were to speak with [[Olanthius]] and seek his aid.

"In order for you to enter this crypt, you must prove that your intentions are pure, and that you truly know in the depths of your soul what you are here to do. Three questions we shall ask you before we permit your entry."

The first question was the name of the village where it all started: *[[Idyllglen]]*
The second was the names of their gods: *[[Helm]], [[Torm]], [[Tyr]], and [[Lathander]]*
The third was the name of the General who Olanthius most often fought alongside: *[[Lady Yael]]*

The spirits asked if [[Uldrak]] would accompany them. The party certainly was fine with it and Uldrak wanted to. The spirits contemplated and this time, unlike the last, allowed his entry, "but I warn you and the rest of your party, that *we* are not your only trial. The ward Olanthius cast over this crypt shall expel any whose heart does not align with the heart of the [[Hellriders]]"
## Interior
There were lidless coffins lining the walls and an inscription read: *"Here lies souls lost to demons’ scourge or devils’ charm, their bodies unrecovered. The former rest glorious, the latter rest anguished, but both rest in tragedy."*

The door to the next room emanated an unfathomably potent divine magic. Even just standing next to it they could feel a strong wave of energy. The doorway was covered with holy glyphs

In celestial, it read: *"Sealed away here is a noble paladin whose sacrifice will not be forgotten by the gods."* Toward the bottom was an insignia of [[Torm]], indicating it was His magic responsible. Kiarin opened the door, and the party was consumed by light.
## Ilsa-vyx and Uldrak
Ilsa-vyx and [[Uldrak]] stepped through the door into a storage closet. Inside was an angelic figure, face shrouded in light with large feathered wings and a well-adorned metal staff.

![[angel.png]]

In a voice like prose the Angel [[Page, the Facilitator]] spoke, *"So you wish to see the one who has given himself up. I will test you. Should you wish to pass my trial, you must do one thing: bury your weapon and slay that devil beside you."*

Uldrak backed away immediately, "I'm not a devil! I'm a giant, I told you! You're not serious, right?"

Ilsa-vyx looked around, thinking that perhaps the trial was a test of mental fortitude or something. Something about the details. She asked if Uldrak could just walk out and that'd be fine, but Paige was insistent.

Uldrak pleaded that he wasn't a Devil, but Paige said that it was through his hedonism that he became a Devil. That he had only himself to blame for his state.

Ilsa-vyx stated that she didn't feel right, as he was fighting for his kin, as was Ilsa-vyx. She said that he could be redeemed.

*"And if redemption is not possible."*

She said that Uldrak had made a promise. This was sufficient for the angel, and she spared Uldrak.
## Mekhi and Evryn
Mekhi and Evryn saw the Angel [[Page, the Facilitator]]. *"Before I permit you to enter this room, you must undergo a trial."*

She first looked to Mekhi, and identified a sea of turmoil within him, secrets he'd kept from his friends and even himself. *"Confess your sins and vices before your friend and before me and you shall pass my trial."*

Mekhi looked around and considered, "Um... Evryn are we- are we chill?"

"Yeah," Evryn responded casually.

"I've uh- done some stuff. My past is my past, but I've done some stuff. Um... mostly work stuff. Um... you know, trespassing, stealing... arson a few times."

"Who are you working for?"

After a moment, "this guy called [[The Collector]], don't really know who he is. And uh, y'know, stuff happens when you're out on the field. Anyway," He looked to the Angel, "is that good?"

*"It is insufficient. You speak only in vague terms."*

He sighed, "there was this one job, this one house, I was just supposed to grab something. A guy had it. He didn't know I was there, I didn't know he was there. There was a... scuffle. A skirmish. Not bad- well, real bad. He almost killed me, but I uh killed him. I got the thing The Collector wanted and opened the bag and it was a silver coin. Not magical or anything. Not particularly valuable. Just... kinda just feels like a waste, I guess." He looked again to Page, "that *sucked*, and I'm sorry about that." He spoke with a bite but his words were no less genuine.

Evryn asked, "so you went into this guy's house and assaulted him and stole his stuff because The Collector told you to?"

"You don't need to mince words. I killed a guy over a tenth of a gold. It sucks for me."

"Why..."

"I can't tell you the why, I don't know why he wants what he wants, but why I follow him I don't got a say in the matter. I'm only really here as I am now in the state I'm in because I owe him a favor. I've got a perpetual debt to pay."

*"Such is the life of one who sells his soul to a [[Demons|Demon]]."*

"I'm sorry? I don't-"

*"I know you are sorry. For that your punishment will be painless."*

Mekhi began to fall. Evryn turned to Page and asked why. "He did what you asked, why are you doing this?"

*"His soul was too corrupted. You have passed my trial."*

"But I didn't do anything!"

*"It is not about what you do, it is what you are. Your soul is pure. I have made my judgement, would you go against it?"*

"It sounds like I am, huh," and he dove after Mekhi. Luminous spectral wings sprouted from his back and they both ascended .

"... I didn't know you had wings."

"I don't advertise it."

"Maybe you should, it's pretty sick."

"Absolutely not."

"Your loss, I guess."

Despite the dramatic moment, Evryn was not very strong and Mekhi was very large and very difficult to carry, especially while flying. Still, they managed to get back to solid ground.

*"You take such a risk to rescue such a sinner. Why?"*

"Because I've spent a lot of time with him and I know he's a good person despite the information that he's withheld from the party up until now."

*"And what do you have to say for yourself?"* the Angel asked Mekhi.

"Even though you tried to off me just then, I'm happy to be virtuous and say that I'm here to right some of the wrongs, I guess. So I'm not good now, maybe, but I'll be better."

*"You must recognize that as long as you are bound by the pact, your soul will be corrupted."*

"I promise I'll change that."

*"You both have passed my trial."*
## Kiarin
Kiarin stepped through the door and everyone was all together. [[Page, the Facilitator]] was still there was well.
## Everyone
*"Well-done, you four. You have each passed my trials and are worthy of speaking with this great fallen paladin."* They were welcome to speak with the paladin should they only step forth through the barrier of light before them. Then Page informed them all they could actually just leave. The rest of the party seemed unusually receptive to this idea, and Kiarin immediately sused it out as a trick.
## Sike, still just Kiarin
She very outspokenly talked about how the trial was a trial and how she'd seen through it easily and she wasn't going to fall for any tricks and through this (and the illusions of the rest of the party still talking and making some semi-in-character jokes) Kiarin was able to make Page laugh, very slightly, very quietly. The Angel commented they had never met a mortal who'd reacted to a trial in such a way, and Kiarin suggested that Page and their illusions could make an alright show in Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter (but probably not [[Waterdeep]]).
## Battlefield
The party found themselves on a battlefield. All they could smell was blood, metal, and death. [[Olanthius]] and [[Lady Yael]] fought in tandem trying to salvage what they could of the situation. A [[Demons|Demon]] the size of a dog charged at Mekhi and he batted it away as the other non-fiends were backed into a corner. He joined the fray, followed by the others.

Yael looked for the reinforcements which would never arrive. From up high, they could see the [[Hellriders]] fleeing, [[Jander]] watching with a solemn expression, and [[Lulu]] and [[Zariel]] fighting against a humanoid-looking war mage-esque [[Demon Lord]], presumably [[Lord Yashio]], encircled by [[The Hidden Lord]]. Just beyond, [[Shummrath]] charged toward the Hellriders; the party. They had to *fight.*

During the combat, Mekhi awoke the soul bound to one of his [[Soul Coin|Soul Coins]]. "When I feel pretty bad," he said to the spectral roguish tiefling before him, "I like hitting stuff." The spirit ran at Shummrath in the hopes of quelling its agony. It seemed familiar somehow, like he'd met someone like it before, though he couldn't quite remember.

The battle was hard fought, but as the party was nearly able to slay Shummrath, [[Gargauth]] appeared and tackled Olanthius, telling the other [[Demon Lord]] that it was time to retreat. "Leave. You are going to die, **Bathael**." Gargauth didn't sound as the party knew him previously, and the name he called Shummrath seemed to hold some power over him.

Despite the best efforts of the party and the Hellriders, they were damned. This story had already been written and all who lived and died did so long, long ago. The party followed as the Hellriders began to retreat; Yael, to find Zariel.

The party split, Evryn and Ilsa-vyx went with Lady Yael; Mekhi and Kiarin, Olanthius. Suddenly, they began to hear a pulsing noise. The demons chasing them began to melt. A streak of black lightning struck each demon, and the pulsing increased in frequency and volume until the demons exploded.

Ilsa-vyx saw a devil with four horns, two small ones jutting from his forehead, two more from the sides of his head. He wore a crimson, spiked breastplate, and in his left hand, six-fingers wrapped around the shaft, he held a *ruby rod*.

![[Chains of Asmodeus.png]]

The devil glided through the air effortlessly as demons melted beneath him. He was as a man walking against ants. He spoke to the party directly, "you don't belong here."

Ilsa-vyx was no more. 

Kiarin was no more.


Zariel, "Where is Olanthius? Where is Haruman?"
Yael, "I know not of Haruman, but Olanthius is doing his best to lead our soldiers to safety."
"It cannot end like this. I sent Lulu out to find him, I hope she finds him safely, but..."
"I'm sorry, my Lady. We've lost."
"Then... Olanthius and Lulu must lead the survivors far away from here. But Yael, there is something I must do for you."

Mekhi was no more. Evryn fell to his knees.

Zariel took a gleaming emerald blade, "Lady Yael, I am sorry I will not be able to travel with you in this endeavor. Take my blade and my spark of goodness. I know what I must do, and I know that I will no longer get to walk side by side with you, or those who I love. Please, do this last thing for me."

[[Asmodeus]] introduced himself without words. "I'd like to ask how you've gotten here, but I simply don't care enough."

Evryn was no more.
## No more no more
They awoke in a room with thing bound by chains. The thing they saw was a mere husk of the man [[Olanthius]] had been. "Who are you four...? Why did I see you in that horrible place...? You saw the battle... I assume you know why we are down here...?"

He went on to explain that he saw two other generals. He entrusted the care of the Hellriders to Lulu, and he saw Lady Yael off with [[The Sword of Zariel]]. Finally, they found the crypt, which they made into a sort of shelter. "For days we stayed down here avoiding the worst. Lulu used her magic to provide food for us, but that's no life. I tasked her with finding Zariel or a way home, and that was the last I saw of her. I did see Zariel, but She... she wasn't the same person you saw in that dream. All she wanted was my servitude and the servitude of everyone here. Those who swore to her became just as wicked, those who refused were slain." He looked down at an old wound, "I believed it was better to die than serve her. I don't know if this is worse than being a [[Devils|Devil]], but it is a true punishment for any righteous person. She left me here until such a time as I am ready to join her, but I never have. I laid my men to rest and prayed to [[Torm]] for the seal which you four broke through. I want to be mad for you breaking through and exposing me to the risk of being used, but... it really is good to see other living souls."

He swore he would help the party if they freed him, but that his oath bound him to Zariel's service and if one day it would overtake him, he would be helpless to resist. Regardless, Olanthius promised to go with the party.
## Quick Sidebar
Mekhi spoke privately with Kiarin, and asked if she could un-attune from [[The Hidden Lord]] for the conversation. She refused, but offered that they could speak in code. Mekhi explained in brief terms the events of his trial (omitting the specifics of his sins), but he noted that [[Page, the Facilitator|Page]] mentioned that he'd made a deal with a [[Demon Lord]], [[The Collector]]. "My soul is not mine, Kiarin," he almost choked up. "I gotta deal with that, and... I'm not telling you this for you to help me out, but he wants me to bring the shield and the person within it to him. I was already pretty miffed about the idea in the first place, but now, knowing what I know, and knowing what you know too, we gotta do something."

Kiarin didn't believe that The Collector was a demon lord, but agreed to help Mekhi. She said that likely the best way to not comply with The Collector would be to just keep [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]] away from Mekhi's patron. Mekhi didn't like her plan but he was glad at least that she was willing to help.
