- The party introduced [[Gargauth]] to [[Ramius Dangremond|Ramius]] and the [[Hellriders]] in [[Elturel]]
	- They weren't thrilled about having a giant [[Demons|Demon]] in the city, but they'd tolerate him so long as he helped protect the city
- [[Zythan Avhoste|Zythan]] informed the party about some observations, most notably:
	- [[The Companion]] was a battery for some powerful magic keeping [[Elturel]] in [[Baator|Hell]]
	- It was dragging the city deeper toward [[The River Styx|The River Styx]]
	- The line from the poem ([[Session 6, 7 August 2024 - Idyllglen|Session 6]]) *"Wrench the pact from clenched jaws; And render null the debtor’s clause"* seemed to point to the pact [[Thavius Kreeg]] signed with [[Zariel]] which would be held in a vault belonging to the [[Ninth City Advocacy Services]], a sort of hellish contractual middleman
- Ilsa-vyx informed Ramius about the party's dealings with [[Levistus]] and he said they shouldn't trust him
- The party hung out at [[The Dancing Horse]] and gave a stunning performance
- Mekhi had a dream wherein his patron reminded him of his duties
- Ilsa-vyx had a dream in which she spoke with Levistus about [[Jade Strongwind|her mother]], but she refused his offerings
- The party set out for [[The Crypt of the Hellriders]] and ran into some [[Devils]] along the way, guarding a strange, disgusting monster
# Verbose
The party headed to [[The High Hall]], where they met [[Hilde & Nullob|Hilde]], one of the [[Hellriders]]. It seemed [[Ramius Dangremond|The High Rider]] wasn't expecting them. They explained they were there to deliver supplies, and that [[Gargauth]] was nothing to worry about. Hilde begrudgingly accepted this, and [[Lulu]] helped quell the concern of the masses as they walked through the streets. When they got to Ramius, they explained the Gargauth situation to him as well. He figured it might as well happen, and asked for a full report.

First, though, he updated them on the state of [[Elturel]]: "I don't know if you saw this as you were ascending, but the battle between the [[Demons]] and [[Devils]] has turned in the Demons' favor. I don't know what this means for Elturel. Additionally, there was a collection of devils that teleported into the city, delivering some supplies from four adventurers. Those adventurers were you, correct?" Secondly, he informed the party that Elturel was steadily descending and that [[Zythan Avhoste|Zythan]] would like to speak with them about it later.

Then, the party spoke a bit on their current leads, specifically mentioning [[Olanthius]] and his Hellriders in [[The Crypt of the Hellriders]]. At the mention of Olanthius, Ramius began to think. Olanthius, as he explained, was his grandfather. He was uncertain if he could have resisted the corruption all this time. Lulu then took the opportunity to talk a bit about the goal to redeem [[Zariel]]. Kiarin mentioned the [[Staff of Power]], and that it would likely be safer than risking their lives giving Zariel a big magic sword.

Finally, Ramius told them that he'd have something for them when they next returned to the [[Avernus|Avernan Wastes]]. Gargauth introduced himself to Ramius as well and vowed to uphold the values of the city, of justice, righteousness, and compassion, and took on the mantle of a provisional Hellrider. All in the name of *kicking dee-vils*.
## Meeting with Zythan
Mekhi made his way to the [[Bancroft Family|Bancroft Household]].

Kiarin spoke with [[Zythan Avhoste|Zythan]]. He mentioned that most of his associates at the [[Lords' Alliance]] were at a loss at what to do. One, though, promised she'd do what she could to help. Regarding [[The Companion]], he'd made some discoveries.

1. The Companion was infused with planar magic that had metaphysically tethered it to [[Avernus]], and it was dragging Elturel into the Hells.
2. The Companion was more like a battery than its own force. It seemed like a source of power fueling some spell keeping Elturel in Avernus.
	- Consequently, if it were destroyed it could be one less chain binding the city.
	- However, the magic would ideally reverse (and this was all hypothesis) if it was destroyed last. Zythan advised not taking any action until more was known.
3. Zythan had also studied the verse they saw in the divine vision ([[Session 6, 7 August 2024 - Idyllglen|Session 6]]). He claimed to have deciphered the following two lines: *Wrench the pact from clenched jaws; And render null the debtor’s clause*. He believed the pact that bound the souls of Elturel's citizens to Zariel, which she signed with [[Thavius Kreeg]], was stored in a vault owned by the [[Ninth City Advocacy Services]]--a middle management business between mortals and [[Archdevil|Archdevils]]--containing all sorts of pacts and contracts. He pointed them in the direction of where he divined it was located.

When asked, Evryn told Zythan that they had met with another Archdevil, [[Levistus]]. Zythan stated that Archdevils were untrustworthy, but awfully convenient and could help the party if they needed to steal the contract. Kiarin asked if the contracts had any extra copies, typically, and Evryn suggested creating a forgery. Zythan then added that the Avernus division of the advocacy services appointed a novice devil by the name of [[Lazivos]].
## About town
Mekhi tracked down a blacksmith, and Ilsa-vyx invited the party to visit a tavern later.
### Ilsa-vyx
Ilsa-vyx reported to [[Ramius Dangremond|Ramius]] about [[Levistus]]. Ramius confirmed she was right not to trust Levistus. Ilsa-vyx then mentioned [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]] and how she didn't trust him, as he used to work for [[Lord Yashio]]. Ramius attempted to divine the nature of the shield, but was prevented by some magical ward. He said he wouldn't trust the shield, and when she explained more about Karnivash's forced servitude to Yashio, he mentioned the name sounded familiar with regards to [[Idyllglen|the Battle of Idyllglen]].

Finally, the High Rider thanked her for doing what was right instead of just what was convenient. "Should you return from your quest, I hope that you would serve [[Elturel]], directly under me. You deserve a higher position. I think you would use it well." Then, he granted her a badge of the [[Hellriders]].
### Mekhi (and the rest)
Swung by [[The Dancing Horse]]. It was just about the only business that was open, so unfortunately no blacksmith trip. It was surrounded on all sides both by tents and guards. Still, inside was busy. The party found a table, and Mekhi mentioned he visited his mom and the food there just tasted like sand, and not even the good kind. After going up to the bartender, [[Burton]], Ilsa-vyx ordered a round for the room, and the atmosphere changed for the better.

Mekhi was looking for a woman named [[Glatha]], who, after a back and forth of names that weren't hers but were similar-ish, got annoyed and spoke up, introducing herself. When asked, the dwarf said she dabbled in smithery. He passed her [[Haruman]]'s armor as a job offer and a potion of stone giant strength as a potential payment. "Tell you what," she said, "I'll take this potion and you do something entertaining for the night."

During this proposition, Ilsa-vyx began spicing drinks with the magic pouch and Burton suggested that if the party didn't put on a good show, he'd reveal *Ilsa-vyx's secret*. While Mekhi was warming up, he slammed three flagons of ale and Evryn fucked up his practice by tricking into doing his scales slightly flat. Mekhi, not wanting to go up on stage alone, convinced Kiarin to go with him by barely goading her.

Kiarin immediately put into play her best moves, dimming the lights... and starting off with a bang, casting *faerie fire* as she started playing some song by the bard [[Brittany Pike]]. Mekhi performed better than expected, causing Kiarin to do literally everything in her power to upstage him. In the end, Mekhi fulfilled his end of the deal.
### Kiarin
[[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]] spoke to her. He apologized again for what he was forced to do. He lamented that the rest of the party didn't trust him, but Kiarin assured him Mekhi's opinion didn't matter on anything, and that Ilsa-vyx was irrationally superstitious, but Evryn would come around sooner or later. She asked if he wanted to do anything mundane and he said he'd like to walk around again. In lieu of that, they strolled about town together.
### Mekhi
Mekhi dreamed of an office, [[The Collector]]'s office, face obscured by wide-brimmed hat. "Mekhi, do you know why I've brought you here?"

"To um... congratulate me on the progress being made on the... doing all the good stuff, yeah?"

"Not quite. Quite the opposite, in fact. I'm quite disappointed in your behavior as of recent. I've told you it is of utmost importance that you retain custody of the shield, yet you continue to antagonize the entity inside it. Your voice may carry influence, and I cannot have you leave it behind."

"We're keeping the shield regardless, my opinion on it aside. My antagonizations of it shouldn't be much of a problem."

"Well they are. So I insist that you keep your comments to yourself."

"... Will do, Boss."

"And do remember," [[The Collector]] said, "it is only by my generosity that you have the power you do. With the snap of my fingers..." he snapped and one of Mekhi's fingers fell off. It didn't reattach.

"Alright, alright," he said with a bit more concern in his voice, "point proven."

*Snap, fixed.*

Mekhi continued, "I'll remember this. I'll be sure to keep it down."

"Perhaps I can also incentivize you by offering a bit of a raise. I've foreseen you'll come across a group of devilish guards, one of whom has a magical breastplate. You are welcome to take it for yourself."

"I'll keep my eye out, then. Anything else you need from me, Boss?"

"Simply your continued obedience."

Mekhi nodded.
### Ilsa-vyx's dream
Ilsa-vyx dreamed again of Elturel, paralyzed to the ground by frost. She was dragged deep into the earth, swallowed only to emerge in an icy lair. Before her was [[Levistus]], the [[Archdevil]]. "Ilsa-vyx," he said, "I would like to offer you something if you'd be so inclined to listen." She could speak, but not move. "I've been thinking about the comments I've made about your mother," he continued. "I've mentioned she is gone, but I'd like to issue you a token to assure you of her wellbeing."

Levistus revealed a pair of weapons: a heavy flail, and a chromatic rapier. These were [[Jade Strongwind|Jade]]'s weapons.

"Why do you have those?" Ilsa-vyx asked, pointedly.

"Because your mother has passed by, and she wishes to bestow one of them upon you."

"What do you mean passed by?"

"I'd be happy to elaborate more if you'd be only so kind as to set aside your presuppositions of me and begin toward some greater trust. I feel as though our relationship is strained, though I have done no wrong to you. I hope to extend this as an olive branch."

"Ilsa-vyx has already made allowances in working with you," and continued on to say in so many words that she did not trust him.

"I find that very hurtful."

"You are an [[Archdevil]], are you a stranger?"

"Just because I am does not mean I cannot exhibit hurt when someone is distrustful through no fault of my own." He continued, "Don't you want to bear one of your mother's legendary weapons? Through a quest so perilous as this?"

"Ilsa-vyx already has legendary friends, she does not need legendary weapons." Levistus withdrew the weapons, and Ilsa-vyx asked, "Can you carry on a message to my mother?"

He confirmed.

"Uh, hi, Mom, Ilsa-vyx is looking for you, and hopefully will see you soon. Then you can give weapons yourself, but until... ough... uhhh..." it didn't sit well with her. And soon the dream ended.
### Evryn
Evryn was visited by [[Ramius Dangremond|The High Rider]]. He was welcomed in and said he'd been thinking about the news the party brought. Specifically, he asked Evryn if the party planned to seek out [[Olanthius]].

He told a story of Olanthius and [[Lady Yael]]. How they fought back against hordes of gnolls, causing chaos within their ranks, managing to distract the beasts long enough for reinforcements to arrive. "I told this to you in the hopes that I could tell you the kind of hero my great, great grandfather was. In the worst case scenario, he has fallen to corruption like Haruman did. I want you to remind him of the story that I told you. Reignite his heroism so he can defend those in need once more."

"I'll make sure that his story gets told," Evryn promised.

Ramius thanked Evryn again for the help he and his party had provided the city, and offered him eighty (80) platinum pieces. "Better in your hands than in the city's coffers."
## In the morning
The party regrouped, and Ilsa-vyx told the party about the [[Session 16, 6 November 2024 - Moments of Calm#Ilsa-vyx's dream|weird dream]] she had. Evryn joked that he sold his soul, and Mekhi believed him. Then he told the truth that [[Ramius Dangremond|Ramius]] offered the party eight-hundred gold's worth of patronage. Then they decided they ought to head to [[The Crypt of the Hellriders]] next.

They stumbled upon [[Lulu]] and [[Gargauth]], and surprisingly they hit it off really well. Gargauth stated that he didn't remember much else beyond just that it's good to kick dee-vils and help humans. He remembered [[Koh Tam]], but he was unaware of his location, and he hoped to see him again one day.

Lulu transformed into a giant wooly mammoth and helped the party descend with Gargauth. As they did, though, [[Shummrath]] told the party to stop and commanded Gargauth to fight alongside the other [[Demons]]. Gargauth, with some help from the party, chose not to, as he swore an oath for the city, not for Demons. This enraged the monster, and Lulu tackled him, affording everyone just enough time to get the hell outta there.

The city grew fainter and fainter, the last thing they saw being [[The Companion]], still crackling in the red sky.
## On the way
They spied a pair of [[Chain Devil|Chain Devils]] watching some strange, floating creature restrained by chains, bleeding black ichor onto the ground below it. A [[Fetchtatter|bat-like fiend]] with green skin and a clockwork breastplate interrogated the prisoner, shouting a mix of abyssal and infernal. Mekhi, having casted *tongues* earlier, understood what they were asking, something about demonic rifts in [[The River Styx]].

The party deliberated on what to do next.
