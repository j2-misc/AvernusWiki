- [[Evryn]]
- [[Ilsa-Vyx]]
- [[Kiarin]]
# Bullets
- Mekhi convinced the party to change their course slightly, that he had a lead for a potential cure for [[Celosia]] at [[Bel's Forge]]
	- That was all he would say, but the party trusted him enough
- [[Olanthius]] spoke with Ilsa-vyx, about the [[Hellriders]], their history since [[Idyllglen]], and his mistrust of the situation, and of [[Devils]] and [[Demons]]
	- Ilsa-vyx comforted him and took his advice to heart
- After skirting around a patrol, the party found themselves at the base of the volcano that [[Bel's Forge]] was carved into
	- It was surrounded by guards
- Kiarin and Mekhi flew up to find an alternative entrance
	- After finding a smoke vent, Mekhi grabbed [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]] and leapt in
	- Kiarin cast feather fall and the two uncomfortably, slowly floated down the vent arguing all the way
- After some time, Ilsa-vyx and Evryn followed, unaware of what had transpired
	- They figured that they would've heard if something bad happened, but decided to go check anyways
	- "Mmm... Mekhi's a screamer." - Ilsa-vyx 
	- "Hm. Yeah." - Evryn
- Eventually, Mekhi floated down into the center of the forge, before [[Bel]] himself
	- Bel drafted a pact according to Mekhi's wishes: The Hidden Lord would be destroyed and Bel would have Mekhi's unwavering service
- At this point, Evryn and Ilsa-vyx flew in and tried to convince Mekhi not to go through with it, but he was convinced it was his only choice
- The Hidden Lord, devoid of allies, magically charmed Kiarin to save him
	- She charmed Mekhi with a weaker, more detectable spell, and for at least an hour everything was fine, and the shield was left untouched
- Bel offered information about [[Zariel]]'s pact stored in [[Ninth City Advocacy Services]]'s [[Avernus]] vault, but the party refused
- Evryn offered instead the true names of [[Shummrath]] and [[Hezmond]] for the freedom of the [[Fire Giant|Fire Giants]] he'd enslaved
	- Once freed, they were directed to the [[Exiles' base]] to reunite with [[Uldrak]] and [[Thiodon]]
# Verbose
Before the party headed out, Mekhi said that the [[Fire Giant|Fire Giants]], [[Thiodon]] and [[Uldrak]], gave him a lead on a "potential cure" for [[Celosia|Evryn's mother]] at [[Bel's Forge]], though he was light on the details. He suggested stopping by it on the way.

> [!NOTE] Eagle-eyed viewers might recall...
> This was a lie and that in the last session, [[Session 22, 2 January 2025 - Quiet]], the giants told Mekhi that he probably shouldn't go to Bel's Forge, but that the magma there could certainly melt any sort of magic.

The party agreed to go. [[Olanthius]] commented that in his time [[Bel]] ruled [[Avernus]]. He didn't seem to be thrilled with the idea, especially given that none of them could be certain whether Bel was still alive or dead. Along the way, Olanthius spoke privately with Ilsa-vyx. "Do you support these people? The idea of working with Bel?"

Ilsa-vyx suggested that if it came down to it they could kick him over, probably.

Olanthius said that all [[Devils]] were the same, and that all they wanted were souls.

"I have never met a Devil with a vendetta before. Maybe that could be something."

"You are a [[Hellriders|Hellrider]]. What has become of the Hellriders."

"Don't do much riding anymore. High Rider Ramius survived the initial assault," she went on to explain in brief some more of the faction's history after [[Idyllglen]]. She could tell he had some real interest in learning of the party's allegiances. With consent, she bit his hand to ensure he wasn't charmed.

"I don't like that I can't feel that."

"Uh... Ilsa-vyx doesn't like it either." She then continued explaining the circumstances by which [[Elturel]] descended. A failing of the [[Thavius Kreeg|The High Overseer]], a dealing with [[Zariel]], and how they found [[The Helm of Torm]]. "Praise [[Torm]]."

"Praise Torm."

She extended some sympathy to Olanthius over his initial reaction to [[Jander]] and confided that stories of him and other generals were part of the reason she'd joined up with the Hellriders to begin with. "They say never meet your heroes, but Ilsa-vyx did just bite your finger so one for one."
## The Forge
They quietly crept past an [[Infernal War Machine]] with some [[Devils]] bearing an insignia of a dark skull with lava pouring from it. Likely a symbol of [[Bel]]; a patrol. They circumvented them and made it to the front entrance. Kiarin and Mekhi found a smoke vent in the side of the volcano, neared it, and suddenly Mekhi grabbed [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]] and leapt into the vent. Unfortunately, his plan to jump into the forge with the shield was foiled by a *feather fall* spell, making the whole ordeal a lot longer and farcical than Mekhi had originally intended.

Back at the car, the other two wondered what was taking them so long. They approached the vent, saw some signs that they'd passed through, and followed.

Mekhi and Kiarin descended into [[Bel's Forge]]. Four chained [[Fire Giant|Fire Giants]] toiled working on new [[Hellfire Weapons]]. Hovering in the air was a giant Devil on a flying throne.

![[Bel.png]]

By some miracle, he hadn't noticed them yet. Mekhi, perhaps not thinking, or perhaps thinking more than anyone ever had, cast *thunderstep*. He appeared with a boom near the magma, but on solid ground. Bel's eyes bore daggers into Mekhi.

"Shit- plan two- BEL! I've got an offer!"

Bel smirked, "So this is how you introduce yourself?"

"I like to be presentable."

"You could've just walked through the front doors. I've been expecting you nonetheless."

"Well I've got an offer for you that-"

"Is that so? I've got an offer for you, and your party. Where are they?"

"Outside."

"I'll send some of my men to gather your party if they're waiting nearby. In the meantime, I'd like to hear about this deal you'd like to make."

Mekhi asked that if Bel melted [[The Hidden Lord]], then he would help him with whatever he needed. Kiarin took the opportunity to hide back in the vent. Karnivash told Mekhi he was making a bad deal, but Mekhi wasn't having it. "You listen here! I know you're working with- you and that *[[Demon Lord]]!* You're in kahoots! So you're gonna die today, you're going to fire, and I... I'll figure something else out."

Bel asked, "Care to elaborate?"

Mekhi said that he knew a Demon Lord that was trying to make moves involving the shield, and that he was hellbent on ensuring it wouldn't be involved.

"I know your shield was of [[Demons|Demon]] make... but I didn't know it was *this* one..." he smiled. "So I suppose you're looking for a new employer?"

"You know," Mekhi fumbled toward a point, "you don't like [[Zariel]], right?"

"I do not."

"Then I guess we can work together. I don't know what you were planning on initially, but... and I don't speak for the rest of my party, but I offer you my services for the shield."

"I accept your offer." Bel had one of the giants bring over a metal slab. He scratched text into it with a gnarly fingernail.

> "I shall pledge unwavering, lifelong fealty to Bel, obeying his commands and following his requests without question. In exchange, I shall receive a fraction of Bel's magical power, dispensed at Bel's discretion. This contract shall nullify all prior entanglements imposed upon the signer. Upon the signing of this contract, the signer will forfeit possession of his demonic shield, to be destroyed immediately."

Kiarin telepathically asked him what he was doing, reading his thoughts so he could respond. He was resigning himself to this. He remembered signing himself to [[The Collector]] in the same way. He was about to sign the contract when Evryn and Ilsa-vyx flew in. Mekhi told them to get out.

Ilsa-vyx told him that Olanthius had warned her of this exact sort of situation. "If you're doing something alone and it's too hard to explain then sure but if you're doing something alone you're doing it alone. If you sign it, you're out. Don't come back."

He was still resolved.

Ilsa-vyx walked away.

Mekhi signed the contract and Bel asked he do the honors. "The magma is hot enough."

The Hidden Lord cried out, "You don't know where the third [[Staff of Power|staff]] piece is! You need my help! Don't go through with this!"
## Ilsa-vyx
The events regarding [[Levistus]] was a big deal to Ilsa-vyx and it was only made tolerable by the fact they were all there, they were all in it together, and that no one else was affected. To Ilsa-vyx, this was the ultimate betrayal. She was hurt and angered even more so for how it might affect Kiarin.
## Evryn
Evryn called out, "Mekhi. Stop. For just a moment."

Mekhi put on a veneer of confidence, near transparently hiding the hopelessness that had consumed him.

"Are you sure this is the right thing to do?"

"It doesn't matter if it's the right thing. This is the only thing I can do."

"If you do this," [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]] spoke up, "your city is damned."

Mekhi said, "I think you're wrong, Karnivash. I trust these other people to figure things out, but at least until then I want to make sure you and your buddy don't get any more ahead."
## Kiarin
Kiarin was content to do nothing at all. For as much as she cared about [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]], she cared about herself more and she was unwilling to make any direct moves against [[Bel]]. The Hidden Lord called to her for her for help, she did not, and so he turned his magic against her.

Against her will, she charmed Mekhi and asked him not to destroy the shield. The rest of the party stepped beside Mekhi.
## Mekhi
"This can't all be for nothing," Mekhi said. "You gotta understand, it's what I can do, right? We can find another way. Evryn, you're smart and you got your natural power, you- you're on the right track. Ilsa-vyx, you're tougher than me you could bash into a wall and the wall would hurt more than your head. And Kiarin, you make a good point but you're creative and I was just kinda bankin' on you guys finding a way to get out of this trap. What I do here could've helped you get out. I did it for you," he looked across the party's faces. Then he looked to Evryn.

"My priority," Evryn said, "is trying to get the people who live here back home. We still need the shield. Unless you can tell me where else we can find a way out."

Kiarin extended her hand to Mekhi, "Give me the shield."

He complied.
## Bel
Smiling like an [[Imp]], [[Bel]] wondered aloud what Mekhi would do. He asked to modify the contract, and he agreed that they'd iron out the details later.

Finally, he had the opportunity to introduce himself to the party. "I am Bel, [[Zariel]]'s Grand Advisor. I loathe her, and I was once before the ruler of [[Avernus]]. I would like my throne back, and I think you have some interest in deposing her." He offered to equip the party with information pertaining to Zariel's contract with [[Thavius Kreeg|The High Overseer]], so they could steal it and free the souls of [[Elturel]].

> “Bel shall divulge a minimum of three useful pieces of information regarding Ninth City Advocacy Services and may opt to divulge more information upon request. Upon the constituents’ request, Bel shall also assign his servant [[Tsorbin]] to accompany the constituents and protect them from harm during the duration of their mission in [[Ninth City Advocacy Services]]. In exchange, the constituents must accept three conditions. First, they shall not speak of the terms of this contract with any external parties\*. Second, they shall not destroy, alter, or otherwise endanger any discovered contracts of devils other than Zariel upon penalty of death. Furthermore, upon the ascent of Bel to the position of archdevil, the constituents shall leave Avernus and never reside within nor step foot into Avernus upon penalty of death.”
> 
> \* - upon penalty of death

Kiarin was confident they wouldn't need the extra help. The party seemed to agree, not entirely willing to get into another new debt. Evryn, however, offered to make another deal with Bel, to release the [[Fire Giant|Fire Giants]].

"They are invaluable to the blood war, part of my arrangement with Zariel. What could you possibly offer to me in exchange for their freedom?"

Evryn offered the [[true name]] of [[Hezmond]], but the former [[Archdevil]] scoffed. "A true name is often enticing, but not that of a third-rate [[Warlord Gangs|Warlord]], a wannabe conqueror."

Mekhi suggested that he needed allies on his side, like the Warlords, if he wanted to make a power grab.

Bel admired Mekhi's spirit but the single true name wasn't enough. Evryn then added [[Shummrath]]'s name to the offer as well.

"You'd need to deal with them sooner or later, once you're in power," Mekhi said.

Bel drafted a contract.

> "Bel shall place the four giants Drumra, Jalt, Rosska, and Zrakorn in the possession of the signers. \[~~They~~ The signers and the giants\] shall be permitted to exit \[a two mile radius of\] Bel's Forge without ~~\[fear of\]~~ transgression from Bel or his servants. In exchange, the signers shall immediately \[~~yield~~ speak\] the true names of the demon Shummrath and the devil Hezmond."

After some amount of back and forth, the party signed the contract, fulfilled their end of the bargain, and left. The surrounding [[Devils]] let the party pass unmolested, and the War Machine was as it was.
## Outside
The party told the giants they were free, and when asked they gave them directions to the [[Exiles' base]], where [[Uldrak]] and [[Thiodon]] were. The giants picked up [[The Meat Grinder]] and ran them over. For the giants it was only like ten minutes, if even that. In broken common, the giants thanked the party and left.
