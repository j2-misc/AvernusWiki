Before they rested for the night, Mekhi looked around for a merchant and was pointed toward the Tinker, who would fix up [[Infernal War Machine|Infernal War Machines]] and the like. Ilsa-vyx found out about an individual by the name of Chen. She and the rest of the party took a trip over. Chen, when they first saw him, was an odd creature with black claws and a single eye, though perhaps something other than a fiend. While inquiring about some items, Ilsa-vyx mentioned the seller’s name, Chen, and he somewhat frustratedly corrected her to a longer variant, [[Mezhikchen]].

Mekhi mentioned that one of the items Mezhikchen was selling fit within one of his core tenets (creativity, money, not dying, ??? <- he’ll get back to us on this one, family, money (very important) (sub-tenant)). Mekhi considered purchasing a particular pouch of dust with soul coins, but the rest of the party dissuaded him. In the end he purchased a bag of dust of sneezing and choking for a few platinum pieces and some gold. Evryn girl math-ed his way to a discount on some pipes of the sewers. Finally, desperate to rid himself of it, Mezhikchen sold Mekhi a jar of sovereign glue, with only enough for one use. Second finally, he sold Ilsa-vyx a wok, thanked them for their business, offered to take anything weird they didn’t want, and the party was off.

They ventured to [[Fort Knucklebones|The Tinker]], in search of repairs for their damaged war machine. There were a lot of noises trying to overpower each other, but a goblin with curly purple hair approached, “need some repairs?” She introduced herself as Clonk and asked them to drive the machine over so they could look at it. The party all chipped in to buy a full repair for about 275 gold. Evryn noticed that this, hell, wasn’t a good place for humanoids. Everyone was either critically employed or incredibly powerful, both out of necessity. [[Clukka & Clonk]] also informed them that the war machines needed either a soul coin a day to operate as normal, or they’d need a bit of your own essence. “It’d hurt you for a bit, and it won’t last as long as a soul coin would, but it’ll power your machine for a bit.”

> **[[Soul Coin]] = 1 day**
> **1 hit die damage = 3 hours**

Before leaving, Mezhikchen informed Ilsa-vyx of a nearby [[The Tower of Urm|Wizard's Tower]]. They then got a shadow shield upgrade and ventured north for [[Haruman's Hill]]. After some deliberation, Ilsa-vyx volunteered to donate some of her life force to fuel the machine. As they ventured toward Haruman's Hill, the party exchanged some magical messages with Zythan, as well as Ramius, updating them on the status of their quest and Elturel. They passed by a large tower with a round iron door and a sizzling, churning moat.

With barely any convincing from Kiarin, Mekhi diverted their course toward it. Along the moat’s shore was a boat with a reinforced metal hull. Shattered marble statues flanked the door. The moat was obviously magical, though conjuration magic specifically which was somewhat odd. Taking a closer look, there was an abjurative ward coating the tower, as well as an aura of conjuration toward the bottom. After a moment of close observation, a bit of brimstone fell from the sky and struck the ward, breaking apart. Kiarin experimented a bit with the ward. After some discussion, they investigated further and found a person in the tower on the third floor deep in concentration about some complicated spell. After some more deliberation, the party decided to split into two groups: Ilsa-vyx and Evryn would talk to whoever lived in the tower, and Mekhi and Kiarin would try to find a way into the tower and “take a look around.”

Evryn and Ilsa-vyx rowed across the moat, and read above the entrance, “Tower of Erm.” The crumbled statues had a lingering sense of transmutation. When Evryn knocked, the presence inside’s thoughts shifted toward something along the lines of, “can’t be that wizard… I’ll send the guards.” Evryn and Ilsa-vyx were telepathically warned, and when the doors opened, they were met with three insectoid, fiendish creatures. Evryn recognized these creatures as Yugoloths, fiends often hired as mercenaries.

The [[Yugoloths]] told Evryn and Vyx that the tower wasn’t accepting guests. The room behind them was in a state of disarray. It was formerly lavish and well-decorated, but in its current state most of the furniture was damaged and tossed about, and the board games seemed as though they were left unattended for some time. Ilsa-vyx, her face showing visible frustration, asked, “is this your house?”

“... Yes.”

Evryn recalled how [[Gideon Brightscored|Gideon]] acted toward the party in the graveyard chapel in [[Westerly]]. These fiends seemed to act similarly. Ilsa-vyx seemed intent on killing the fiends; the fiends, the party. Great minds and all that.
