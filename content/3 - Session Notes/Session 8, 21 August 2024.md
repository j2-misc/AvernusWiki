# Verbose
After some coordination between the team and with the necromancer who’d held Bitterbreath in a magical grasp, they managed to evict him from his own vehicle and drive him off. He cursed their names as he fled, “You’ll live to regret this! You don’t know who I know!” Afterwards, the necromancer’s vehicle drove parallel to [[The Meat Grinder]], and she congratulated the party, surprised they did so well.

She thanked them for the help and mused, “I’m sure [[Bitterbreath]] won’t be a problem for the foreseeable future without his prized vehicle.” Then she introduced herself, “My name is [[Feonor]], who are you four?” After introducing themselves, they asked her about what she was doing here. She said that she and her undead crew–[[The Golden Doom]]–scoured the land for resources. She was working in hell specifically because it was a particularly resourceful place. “I find my business here rather profitable,” perhaps this was obvious given her gilded vehicle. When asked if she was from [[Fort Knucklebones]], she answered that she wasn’t, even going so far as to state she preferred the Wandering Emporium, despite some complaints with the owner.

Evryn inquired about whatever story might be there, and after some pressing, she explained [[Mahadi]], the owner, was not shy about his unrequited affections for her. Then she changed the subject to the division of spoils. She offered she’d put in a good word at [[The Wandering Emporium]] for them in exchange for Bitterbreath’s vehicle, and of course they could keep the other one they found. The party then took a moment to discuss what they’d do. Either they could go along with the deal and maybe get some good connections, or they could just try and run off with two really cool cars. Eventually, with a tie-breaker from the Hidden Lord, the party largely decided to go along with the deal (though Ilsa-vyx did notice and Kiarin later stole the two soul coins stored in the glove compartment).

Mekhi made it clear in no uncertain terms that the vehicle was theirs, and that they earned it by bailing her out of a fight. It was rightfully theirs, but they would let her take it. “My, my. You’re not going to make many friends here. Would you kindly exit my vehicle?” The party did (some more dejected than others), and Feonor suggested they might work together again later before driving off.

[[The Tormentor]]

Mekhi gave a Horn of Blasting to Kiarin, and Kiarin gave Evryn the [[Soul Coin|Soul Coins]]. He listened to the soul coins and one of them spoke. His name was [[Ashton Dungress]] and he was seemingly tricked by a devil, which was why he was currently a coin. Before he was a coin, he was a duelist of some renown. He met with a fiend, [[Hezmond]], with a blazing rapier, so he challenged him to a duel and of course, he lost. He thanked Evryn for listening, and advised him not to make any deals like he did.

They approached [[Fort Knucklebones]], Mekhi correctly guessed the password (“password”), and they were let in.

They parked between a number of other machines, and wandered around the fort. They saw some more of the gnomes that were guarding the gate, as well as a strange-looking, somewhat [[Mickey|insectoid creature]].

Some signs pointed to “Tinker,” “Well,” “Arcade,” and “Hostel.” Ilsa-vyx helped out the creature–Mickey, apparently–by freeing a bone from its foot and the party later ran into a grandmotherly-ish figure at [[Fort Knucklebones|The Arcade]]. She called herself [[Mad Maggie]].

She mentioned they didn’t often get visitors like the party, and when asked she offered that [[Koh Tam]] frequented [[Fort Knucklebones|The Well]], and she admitted that she was the leader around the Fort, and talked some amount of smack about the [[The Wandering Emporium]]. They made for the Well, where they saw a number of hellish figures, but one being of light stood out among the crowd.

While Kiarin and Mekhi argued about who was supposed to remember the questions they had for Koh Tam, Ilsa-vyx got some drinks from the bar, tended to by the more talented of two twin sisters, [[Natasha]]

Koh Tam offered to the two idiots that he could answer some questions about how to save [[Elturel]]. He said that nothing of this sort had ever happened before, but he could relay to them some history about [[Zariel]], who brought Elturel here in the first place. He explained that Zariel was a devil, the current ruler of Avernus and the leader of the battle against the demons in the Blood War. Koh Tam inferred that she wanted to bolster her strength by siphoning the souls of Elturel. He mentioned an idea he’d had earlier, perhaps the key to the liberation of both Elturel and perhaps even Zariel. “It is an uncommon occurrence for celestials to fall and become fiends… so perhaps it is not impossible for fiends to ascend to celestials. If there is a chance Zariel ascends to her celestial form, then she could be the key to Elturel’s salvation. Of course this is just a theory.”

Mekhi mentioned that they previously killed one of Zariel’s generals, Haruman. Koh Tam interrupted that he was the guardian of a graveyard where Hellriders would be tortured for all eternity, and that without him guarding it, they could be freed. “There could be your opportunity. Seek out Haruman’s Hill and you could find more answers than I could ever give you.”

Finally, Koh Tam offered that Maggie allowed travelers to set up at the Hostel free of charge.
