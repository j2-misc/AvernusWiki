# Verbose
Mekhi was in favor of killing the [[Devils]], interrogating the [[Demons|Demon]], and then killing it too. Ilsa-vyx took a look and could only identify two of the Devils as [[Chain Devil|Chain Devils]]. The other two she couldn't identify, other than the fact the strange floating thing was a Demon. The [[Fetchtatter|bat-like fiend]] wearing the magical breastplate couldn't even be narrowed down to a similar categorization.

In the end, the party decided to use [[The Meat Grinder]]'s catapult to fling Ilsa-vyx at the fiends before then charging in to run them over. This turned out to be a really good idea, actually, as the goblin impacted the [[Fetchtatter|bat-like]] thing. Evryn followed up with a *shatter* as they drove up and ran over the two devils! One was quickly gobbled up, followed shortly thereafter by the [[Fetchtatter|bat-like fiend]] who Ilsa-vyx shoved into the [[Infernal War Machine|machine]]'s mouth. The battle seemed as good as won, though the fiends tried best they could to claw their way out. The [[Fetchtatter|bat-like fiend]] in-particular teleported into the vehicle, like the strange fiend they'd previously encountered at [[The Tower of Urm]] ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024 - Haruman's Hill|Session 10]]). He downed Kiarin, prompting the rest of the party to kick into gear focusing their efforts on downing the monster. Ilsa-vyx dealt the final blow, defenestrating it and following it up with the **Elturel Elbow**. "You idiots," the fiend cried, "don't think this is the last you've seen of me!"

The party wasn't entirely sure what it meant, but Mekhi was able to tell that it was a [[Yugoloths|Yugoloth]]. Notably, this one and the one at the tower didn't attack with much regard for their own well-being.
## After the fight
The party too notice of the [[Demons|Demon]]. Some of the chains that bound it were drenched in a sort of acidic bile. It paid the party little mind as Mekhi inspected the [breastplate](https://5e.tools/items.html#breastplate%20of%20balance_bmt). Then turning his attention to the demon, Mekhi told it that the party were working for [[Shummrath]].

In common, the demon responded. It said that the party didn't seem like demonic thralls, but that the name was familiar to it. It asked in a distrusting tone, "why has Shummrath sent *mortals* and not *demons* to free me?"

Mekhi said that the party was, while not demons, "a bit more reliable than your fellows."

It almost seemed convinced, before its eyes narrowed on Evryn. "He is no thrall. Why do you have one of *him* amongst your ranks?"

The party quickly huddled up to discuss, and then asked the demon what its problem with Evryn specifically was. "Shummrath didn't have a problem with him."

"No offense intended, but Shummrath is rather dense." After a moment, it continued, "has one among your ranks not explained itself?"

Evryn explained that they arrived in hell with the rest of Elturel. This wasn't an answer that satisfied the demon. It asked the party free it, "then I will tell you what you need to know."

Kiarin consulted with [[The Hidden Lord]] who advised against trifling with a [[Sibriex]], though admitted they were characteristically slow. The party attempted to charm the monster, failed incredibly, and were poisoned by magic as they fled. [[The Meat Grinder]] started up again as the Sibriex melted another one of its chains and spat some acid at the [[Infernal War Machine|machine]], far more damaging than anything the [[Devils]] had tried.

Thankfully, the remaining restraints allowed the party to escape, having made a powerful enemy.
## Further along the road
The party encountered a monument, where one of Evryn's [[Soul Coin|Soul Coins]], [[Ashton Dungress]], spoke up. "This," he said, "was where I was tricked. Avenge me, and I will do my best to guide you."

The party exited [[The Meat Grinder]], leaving one of Mekhi's eyes behind to keep watch. As they ventured forth, they encountered two imposing wardens: a purple devil with small-ish horns and gaudy jewelry, and a bear of a fiend with wings like knives.

The purple fiend said that they wouldn't be allowed to pass through, as it was [[The Grinning Blade|Grinning Blade]] territory, and that he was the Grinning Blade. Unless, of course, they paid the toll (100 gold a head). Ashton spoke just to Evryn, that the so-called "Grinning Blade" was [[Hezmond]], the [[Devils|Devil]] that soul-trapped him after a duel.

"A hundred gold is a lot," Evryn started. "Maybe we can come to some other arrangement?"

"I'm all ears!" said Hezmond, grinning wide.

The party quickly huddled up to ideate a proposition. Ashton insisted that Evryn duel the Devil. With Ashton's spectral rapier in hand, he grinned, "Care for a duel?"

"What are the stakes?" he asked.

Mekhi offered if the Devil were to lose, then he would lose his reputation.

"I suppose, but you..." his grin widened, "have a bit more to lose."

The party offered a [[Soul Coin]] if Evryn were to lose. Hezmond countered that if he would win, he'd take Evryn's soul as well.

"In return, if I win," Evryn said, "I want you to do something for us."

"What would that be?"

Evryn paused to consider. "If I win, you have to give me your true name."

For a moment, Hezmond faltered, only to smile once more and nod. "Since I get two things if I win, it's only fair you get two if you do." He then conjured a book of songs and stories, a fantastic compilation, as it seemed.

The terms were set. They shared a gentlemanly handshake.

Imbued with expertise not his own, Evryn made the first strike.

"I recognize this style!" Hezmond taunted, "what are you up to, little duelist?"

"What does it look like? Having a duel."

"Suppose I'll have to figure this out," smile unwavering, he slipped forward and landed a devastating blow. The duel quickly turned in Hezmond's favor, even with some interference from the other party members. Evryn managed to pull things back, noting that the Devil was far worse off than he let on, and when it tried to underhandedly stab the Bard in the back, Ashton's spirit reacted and avoided the strike! Even still, the opportunity he was afforded required just a bit more aid from Ashton, and together the two were able to pierce Hezmond. It would be lethal had he not soon after downed a healing potion.

"What trick was that? What magic did you pull?!" referring to some illusions cast from the sidelines.

Evryn took credit, mimicking the magic on his own, "No trick. Just a bit of magic."

The duel lost, his true name revealed, [[Hezmond|Henzie Torre]] swore next he saw Evryn he'd take his soul. The Devil threatened him, but Evryn invoked its name, "You will not accost me or my party. You will not come after us. Nice doing business with you," Evryn said.
## Stowaway
As the party made it back to their vehicle, Kiarin noticed, and Mekhi's eye observed in greater detail, a [[Spined Devil]]--a miserable little thing pressed against the back wall. What they thought was an assailant, when confronted, claimed instead to be a stowaway. "I don't wanna work for these guys," it said. "Just go, please, and I'll tell you everything."

![[Uldrak.png]]

The party complied, and the devil explained, "My name is [[Uldrak]], and I need your help." Evryn cast a *zone of truth* on in the vehicle so it couldn't lie, and it continued to explain, "I used to live there at that campsite, but they took that from me and forced me to work for them."

"Well whatever. You're a [[Devils|Devil]], right?" Mekhi said.

"No, I'm not," Uldrack said, "I have the body of a devil, but I am a Giant Champion of [[Surtur]], and I came to kill [[Bael]]." His others were enslaved, and he sought to free them, but he failed. "Bael still lives. People still live as slaves." He swore to Surtur he'd kill Bael, but was tricked. "That's what I hate most about these Devils."

After a moment's hesitation, Evryn suggested visiting [[Celosia]], without naming names.

Ilsa-vyx asked if Uldrack felt any evil, devilish compulsions. He said he didn't and was offended to even be asked. They talked a bit about their next objective and he said that he could lead them to [[The Crypt of the Hellriders]], but that there were spirit guards dead set on not letting anyone through.

As they carried on, Evryn spoke with [[Ashton Dungress|Ashton]], his voice faint. He wouldn't be around much longer. He thanked Evryn, and the coin disintegrated in his palm. 

*"Have a nice trip."*
