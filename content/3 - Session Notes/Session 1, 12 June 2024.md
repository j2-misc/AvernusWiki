# Verbose
It is early evening in the Holy City of [[Elturel]]. Mekhi was walking. Previously, Ilsa-vyx had tailed him to ensure he wasn’t up to any trouble. Now Vyx found herself on patrol with a mule chowing down for the late shift. Kiarin was wandering around the city looking for a bright, shiny shield. Meanwhile, Evryn was playing some songs on his fiddle.
## Summons
At some point, everyone was found by a courier who provided them with a letter inviting them to a dinner at the High Hall in the interest of helping the city. It was signed by [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]]. 

>*"Good tidings to you,*
> 
> *I write with the purpose of inviting you to a cordial dinner at High Hall. I have heard news of your remarkable talents and seek your assistance for an important investigation. I shall share more news at the dinner, so please come if you have an interest in helping the city.*
> 
> *Kind regards,*
> *High Rider Ramius"*

Elturel’s [[The High Hall|High Hall]] was both a religious site as well as a political one, as the city was a theocracy. Once there, they were all escorted to a lobby outside the dining room. A staff member thanked them for their arrival and asked them to wait before leaving the four alone in the lobby.
## Appearances
- [[Mekhi]]
	- Orc
	- Satin jacket
	- Walking stick on his back
- [[Evryn]]
	- Human guy, early 20’s
	- Messy hair, above shoulder-length, bleach-blonde
	- Saturated blue eyes
	- Good sense of style, maybe not as flamboyant as Kiarin’s outfit, but still dressed to impress
- [[Ilsa-Vyx]]
	- Goblin, little under 3 feet tall
	- Wearing typical hellrider get-up (a little big for her, definitely a hand-me-down)
	- Massive leaf-shaped ears
	- Wields a maul twice her height
- [[Kiarin]]
	- Drow
	- Showy outfit with a lot of accoutrement.
	- Entertainer presenting.

The party then spent some time dunking on Mekhi and talking amongst themselves (Vyx was glad to see her sister in the city, though neither knew the other was there until just then). Afterwards, the party was brought into the dining room to have dinner with the High Rider. It was odd to see him out of his plate, though he still wore a military uniform. He was a grizzled, stoic looking man in his late forties, with graying hair and a thick beard. He was flanked on either side by guards, and welcomed the party warmly, “Thank you for arriving so hastily! Please, take a seat!”
## Meeting with Ramius
Mekhi asked if they were in trouble, and the High Rider confirmed they were not, “Quite the opposite,” and then stewed beef was served. As they started to eat Ramius asked how everyone was liking the city.

Mekhi answered that he lived there and turned the question back on Ramius. Ramius then asked, “You’re one of the Bancroft’s right? I just wanted to make sure your family is doing well.” Mekhi avoided the question and continued eating.

Ils-vyx reported that she got a new shirt with her recent promotion, and that she was tailing a new lead, which Ramius confirmed was part of the reason he called them all here. After confirming that he’d heard of both Kiarin and Evryn after, he told them all that “each of you exhibit qualities that would make you great for an expedition of being trying to conduct in the city. For the last week, I’ve been receiving reports of people going missing in the dragoneye docks.” This coincided with the arrival of certain suspicious groups in the city. Ramius’s informants suggested it had something to do with cult activity. “Just two days ago I sent a pair of recruits to investigate the area, and… Sadly to say, they’ve not yet returned. I’m worried. I know something is happening in this area, but I don’t know what. That’s where you four come in. You see, we hellriders aren’t accustomed to infiltration. We’re troops, guards first and foremost. You four have proven to be exactly what we need. If you’re willing to assist us in this investigation, you’d be compensated. And you’d be doing the city a great service.”

He wanted them to investigate the abandoned dock district, and if they encountered cultists they were to bring them to justice. Put an end to the disappearances. “I can offer you each 100 gold for the investigation.” Part of why he requested the aid of the party was because he was unable to get any assistance from the High Overseer. “High Overseer Kreeg has been quite reserved these days. It’s hard to get anything out of him.” Kreeg was unaware of Ramius hiring the adventurers.

After the initial discussion, Ramius opened the floor for Evryn to ask questions. “You’ve only been the leader of the Hellriders for a month now?”

“That’s right.”

“How’s that transition been?”

“It’s been going well. It’s an honor, and I hope to do my city proud. I have quite the legacy to protect.”

“Is that so?”

“Indeed. My father and his father before him were the High Riders. It’s been a position of great honor that’s passed from generation to generation. I hope to do my father and his father proud, and I hope my son will do me proud when he comes of age.”

Mekhi meanwhile mentioned he knew of a nice dive nearby which he attested served stirge–good tasting stirge. This was contested, of course, by Kiarin and it then evolved into a minor argument between Ils-vyx and Mekhi.
## Back to the questions
The High Rider confirmed he liked to keep a good eye on his troops.

“In that case, I was wondering if you know of anybody associated with your group by the name of Celosia.”

“[[Celosia]]… Indeed I do. I’ve heard of her. She… went missing. I want to say… thirteen years ago, if I recall correctly. It was never discovered what happened to her, but I hope she’s well. Our work is dangerous.”

“I see. Well, thank you for that information. I think that’s all the questions I have,” Everyn concluded.

“If you have any more questions, you’re welcome to ask. I have nothing to hide.”

…

“Me either,” commented Mekhi after a moment of silence. “Shouldn’t have said that.”

Then, they made their way to the docks…

Mekhi told Evryn that the shop with the boarded windows used to serve stirge. No way of confirming that now. They saw guards patrolling nearby in a focused loop, emerging from one alley into the street. Mekhi noticed the guards were just patrolling the same block. Ils-vyx noticed that the guards were dressed particularly strangely. They weren’t wearing any armor, carrying any weapons. They had badges, but weren’t familiar to Ils-vyx.

Evryn suggested he talk to the fake guards. Kiarin backed him up and Ils-vyx and Mekhi lagged behind. The guards told Evryn the area was off-limits to civilians. Their eyes were shifty throughout the whole interaction, a detail which Evryn picked up on. They reconvened with the rest of the party. They then decided, upon Evryn’s suggestion, that they simply sneak in through the side door. He distracted the guards with an illusory rat as they did, allowing them to sneak into the warehouse without issue. (Ratthew cameo)

The room was filled with gear one might need for fishing, but there was also a stairway leading further down. Following the stairs, they were led to a tunnel, like a series of chambers one might find in a dungeon. They found the following symbol etched into the wall: ![[OccultSymbol.png]]

Evryn thought it could’ve been some sort of religious symbol, but didn’t recognize it. Ils-vyx noticed some blood on the wall and that it was about a week old. Ramius told them that some Riders went missing two days ago. This was not their blood. The party then descended into the tunnel, smelling of blood and filth. There was a dark, murky liquid with a southwestern pathway leading out. Large chunks of wood and stone debris piled against the floor and southern wall. Buried under the debris, Kiarin found another pathway. It looked like it’d been there for quite some time. Kiarin got Mekhi to move the rubble for her, which he did with incredible skill.

Then, the party moved down the narrow tunnel. Ahead, they saw a room illuminated by dancing lights, where they heard excited conversations. Similarly to the previous room, there was a pool of murky black water which smelled of conjuration magic.

This was no good. These were cultists, and so they made the first move. Kiarin went first, rendering two cultists unconscious with a spell. One ran into melee with Vyx and she easily dodged the attack. It was around then that their leader called out to the followers to kill the party. This was notable less so for his words and more so for his claws which he had in place of claws. Cultists surrounded the party and Ils-Vyx ran up to the head cultist, attacking him before Evryn cast a hypnotic pattern over the cultists, though it included Ils-Vyx in the area. However, Ils-Vyx’s fey ancestry shielded her from the charm.

At the end of the first round, the leader tried to cast some spell, but their concentration was broken. Later, when one of the regular cultists was slain, the leader tried to cast another spell, Mekhi tried to counter it, but in the end the leader was able to get the spell out and heal himself. Again at the end of the next round, he tried to cast a spell, but failed.
# Summary
The party, in [[Elturel]], was summoned by [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius Dangremond]]. Over dinner, he asked them to investigate strange happenings on the [[Dragoneye Docks]], a quest which was assigned to them in secret from [[Thavius Kreeg|The High Overseer]]. At the docks, they found some guards circling a singular building, not dressed up to the standard of a real [[Hellriders|Hellrider]]. The party snuck past them into the warehouse and found a dungeon underneath, with occult symbols and happenings. In one chamber, they found a group seemingly trying to summon something from brackish water, demanding sacrifices. They incapacitated them all, interrupting their plans. Though this was only the beginning of far more sinister things to come.
