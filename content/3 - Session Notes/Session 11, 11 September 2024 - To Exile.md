# Verbose
The party considered helping [[Jander]] down. Mekhi raised the point that the last time they saw a [[Zariel|High Hellrider]] in [[Avernus]], it was [[Haruman]] who tried to kill them. Jander opened his eyes and asked them about Haruman, who’d put him there. He seemed thankful when they said they’d killed him.

Ilsa-vyx told him about the vision they received from [[The Helm of Torm]], and asked if he spoke to them ([[Session 6, 7 August 2024 - Idyllglen|Session 6]]). He said he didn’t, and that he doubted the gods cared about him.

“If you’re favored by the gods, then I’m obliged to help you,” Jander said.

After consulting with the rest of the party, Ilsa-vyx asked Jander about what she’d heard him say in the vision, then asking him what the “sins” could be.

“I have committed many sins. I let my fellow Hellriders die. We charged into hell, and the fiends,” he paused looking around at the hellish landscape. “I led my legion and any who wanted to flee back through the portal the demons conjured. What else could I have done? We were doomed the moment we set foot in this place, but [[Zariel]] would not see reason.”

“If you made it back through the portal,” Evryn started, “how did you end up back here?”

Jander opened his mouth, revealing his vampiric fangs. He closed his mouth, then spoke, “I’m not just a sinner, I am shrouded in sin- mired by it, because of who I am. I was corrupted long ago.” He explained that his craving for blood grew stronger and stronger, and he prayed to [[Lathander]] to take the curse from him, and he stepped out into the sun unprotected by his ring, “but his eyes turned away. I did not receive atonement, instead I appeared here. I’ve been here ever since. Perhaps this is how I must atone.”

Ilsa-vyx took a step back, unnerved knowing the creature before her was a [[Vampire|vampire]]. She asked how he was corrupted, and Jander explained he was corrupted by a vampire whom he tried and failed to resist. “It was a vampire long ago, by the name of [[Cassiar]]. I managed to slay him in the end, but I took on his curse. He’s long dead now, though.”

Mekhi wondered aloud if vampires go to hell when they die. Typically only creatures with souls continued on to the outer planes after death on the material. Though, Jander was here. Undead didn’t typically have souls, but perhaps Jander did, and unfortunately that might speak for the rest of vampire-kind as well, meaning there was a possibility that Cassiar was in [[Baator]] with the rest of them.

“What do you intend to do with me?” Jander asked, resignedly.

“Does Jander need to feed like vampires do?” Ilsa-vyx asked.

Jander explained that the [[Stirge|stirges]] kept him fed.

“Is it the blood of the other Hellriders?”

Jander’s silence spoke more than words could.

“Believe me,” Jander started, “it is not by choice. Please, free me from this hill.”

The party considered what to do. Ilsa-vyx expressed her discomfort with the idea of working alongside a corrupted being, and raised the point that atonement might be an end to Jander’s story.

Kiarin asked about the ring he mentioned. He explained it was a ring he took from his corrupter that allowed him to walk in daylight, though it didn’t stave off the hunger. When Evryn asked, he explained that in refusing to become a monster, he became a soldier, and that Zariel accepted him in spite of what he was.

Jander said, “Perhaps the gods have sent you to be my final judge. Whether you decide to kill me or set me free, I will accept whatever you decide.”

Ilsa-vyx took a few minutes to pray while the others discussed what to do. Evryn felt that allying with him was the only sensible thing to do, though Kiarin had a number of doubts, and Mekhi was staunch that they should at the very least never let him anywhere near [[Elturel]]. Then, Ilsa-vyx returned. She pointed out that all of them (even Mekhi, though it took some effort to admit it) were chosen by [[Torm]]. “If it wasn’t for the gods, I would not work with you,” she said to Mekhi. She then explained, “for the same reasons, Ilsay-vyx does not want to free him. Although we are in the place where bad people go, the gods have not foresaken Elturel and have not forsaken us. They have given us a way, and asked things of us to be redeemed… but this is not true for Jander. Jander was not abandoned. Abandoned is the wrong word. Jander was…”

“Foresaken?” Mekhi said.

“Your knowledge of words bothers me,” Ilsa-vyx responded. “Ilsa-vyx listens to texts but finds it difficult to read.” She asked the other three if they knew of any stories of redeemed vampires.

Evryn said that he did. He didn’t, of course, but he knew how to craft ethos when it was otherwise lacking. He spliced together a story wherein a vampire, through good works, redeemed themselves and helped their community for the better. He recalled a story his mother told him once about a wandering vampire turned soldier. The party had some discussion before finally asking the Hellriders.

[[Helen]] spoke up, attesting that he suffered more than anyone else there and that she respected him. “If you’re deciding whether to spare or slay him,” she said, “the things that have happened are not his fault.”

Despite some contention on how exactly any proposed blood donation would work (and the amount of potential donors), everyone seemed pretty alright with sparing Jander. He swore that if ever he would succumb to his hunger, he would ensure his death before any harm befell anyone else. Ilsa-vyx then gave Haruman’s Blade to Helen, who swore she’d be the one to keep Jander in check.

Evryn then suggested dispeling Jander’s curse with the scroll he’d found a while back at the chapel in Elturel’s [[The Grand Cemetery|Grand Cemetery]] ([[Session 5, 31 July 2024 - Graveyard Shift|Session 5]]). The party also argued a bit about where to keep him after, but whatever they decided, they’d need to get him down first, so they started with that.

“I know there are not many stories of a redeemed vampire. But perhaps, gods willing, I may be the first.” They would head to [[Fort Knucklebones]] and decide what to do from there. However, they would have to deal with a warband first.
## The warband approached
Four war machines, three fairly lightly equipped, one larger than any they’d seen before. Though, some of the weapons on their machines seemed inoperable. The party decided to approach, either to see what they want or perhaps try and scare them off. The vehicles stopped before the camp and the leader stepped out–a brawny woman with orange hair and silver knuckles adorning her fists.

“Well, what do we have here?” she asked.

“Just a group of individuals touring around Avernus, as one does. How about you?” Evryn said.

“You ain’t foolin’ me. All I wanna know is if you’re friend or foe.” She introduced herself, “name’s [[Hellripper]], lieutenant of [[The Hells' Exiles]]. Seems you beat us to Haruman’s Hill. You workin’ for some fiend? Why’d you come here?”

“My name is Evryn. We came here looking for individuals.”

“The [[Hellriders]]? Looks like you found ‘em. What’re you tryin’ to do with ‘em?”

“Help them atone,” Ilsa-vyx answered.

“Seems we can be friends, then! Boss told me to come here and pick these guys up, bring ‘em somewhere else. You four are welcome to come with. This place ain’t kind to people like us.”

They asked who her boss was and she told them she worked for [[Celosia|Cockscomb]], “very busy lady, she is.” Apparently The Hell’s Exiles had been in [[Avernus]] for **seven or eight years**. When pressed on this, she explained, “the boss moves slow. She gets anxious ‘round these parts. I was one of the first to get on board, built up this gang to help other folks like us stranded in hell. Now I’m gonna tell you something you probably won’t believe, but the boss’s got some kinda magic, the kind that can turn a [[Lemure|lemure]] back into a human. I think it’s a miracle or somethin’. I used to be one, but the boss gave me my soul back, same for a lot of people in the gang. But we gotta work quiet. Moment upper management finds out about what we’re up to here, they’ll squash us like a pack of [[Stirge|stirges]].”

They considered whether or not to disclose [[Jander]]’s vampirism to the Exiles, and eventually decided to after an extended discussion where the lengths to which diviners can spy on someone with which they’re familiar were brought up. Regardless, they told the Exiles who didn’t seem to care too much, and they all followed them to their base.

Before leaving, however, Ilsa-vyx tried to take a branch from the tree. There was a [[Raragin|Raragin]] that she hadn’t seen before. It galloped away and vanished.
## On the road
Evryn asked [[Hellripper]] why she was so open to trusting the party. She said that you have to, “it’s all us folk suffering together. Against all those fiends…” She mentioned that she’d seen the name Evryn before on some document of her boss’s. “Could’ve been an ‘Evelyn’ for all I know, but I guess it’s just I got a hunch for these things.” They talked about why the party was here, how Elturel was was dragged into hell.

They made some idle chatter. When asked, Hellripper didn’t disclose where she hailed from before she went to hell. After a while, though, more vehicles showed up, filled with fiends. Hellripper identified them as [[Eighth Remnant]], one of the [[Warlord Gangs]].

During the chase, Hellripper directed Mekhi through a nearby bog while the rest of the party tried to stall their pursuers, casting spells and the like trying to render vehicles inoperable. All the while, one remaining fiend loaded up a canon. They managed to make a leap over a chasm, though their axle was damaged in the process. Hellripper assured the party they’d get their car fixed up.
## After the chase
Hellripper informed the party they were lucky to be able to rid themselves of their pursuers. Gang was filled with nothin’ but devils–the mean kind. [[Bitterbreath]] and his [[The Marauders|Marauders]] were mentioned, and Ilsa-vyx bragged that they took their machine from him and put him on his ass ([[Session 7, 14 August 2024 - Welcome to Avernus|Session 7]], [[Session 8, 21 August 2024 - Fort Knucklebones|8]]). Eventually, they made it to an inconspicuous cave, only big enough for a few vehicles to pass through at a time. It sloped down into darkness. “Follow the car ahead very closely. Don’t want you gettin’ lost.” After a while navigating through darkness, they made it.
## The Exiles’ base
There was a garden, a mural along the wall behind it depicting an idyllic scene. About a dozen pathways branched from it. There were even parents watching over their children. [[Hellripper]] said the place was made livable thanks to the work of some druids.

Mekhi went with the Exiles to drop off [[The Tormentor]]. There was a [[Fire Giant|fire giant]], [[Thiodon]], with a number of piercings in her ears, and Hellripper assured him she’d take good care of their car.

![[Thiodon.png]]

The party waited by the garden. The children playing couldn’t have been older than six. There was a young orc boy, and an elf girl, and they seemed happy. A group of parents kept an eye on them.

After a while of waiting, Hellripper returned, accompanied by a serene woman, brow furrowed. Her expression softened when she saw the party; Evryn, even more so. This was [[Celosia|his mother]].
