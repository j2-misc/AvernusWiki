# Verbose
[[Uldrak]] offered to take over driving while the party rested (which Mekhi unwillingly took him up on). Kiarin spoke with [[The Hidden Lord|Karnivash]] and asked him how the party could free him once the [[Staff of Power]] was complete. He shared with her the words he'd use to free himself, but asked her not to repeat them. The words seemed powerful, and it made enough sense that [[Aurumvas]] was nearsighted enough not to realize the strength of the magical items he'd hoarded. Ilsa-vyx took the opportunity to reheat some leftovers from [[The Infernal Rapture]] (they're still good, she swears).
## Crash!
The party awoke to the sound of a crash, the vehicle shaking. [[Uldrak]] was flung to the back of the vehicle. A large, bony devil, almost equestrian in shape, had landed on [[The Meat Grinder]]. [[Raragin]] had returned, and with reinforcements. `"Get out of your vehicle,"` he commanded. He didn't draw any weapons, however. `"I've come with a demand, from my Master. You will accompany me to speak with her."`

Evryn laughed out of disbelief. The party was flabbergasted. After a brief back and forth, the party deduced that Raragin's orders were to bring them to [[Zariel]] so they could discuss something (or rather someone; [[Olanthius]]) that she wanted. The party, not about to hand over Olanthius to Zariel, swung first.

The party quickly got to work shoving Raragin off the vehicle, and with a coordinated enchantment from Evryn, the fiend's legates were stupefied and incapacitated while the [[Infernal War Machine|Machine]] kicked into gear. Ilsa-vyx hooked herself up to the vehicle, which immediately drained almost all of her life energy, nearly killing her in an instant.

Raragin quickly caught up to them and revealed his hand, `"One word and the Warlords will descend upon Hell's Exiles like birds of prey."` This gave the party some pause.

Evryn reasoned that even if they were to go with them, there was no reality in which [[The Hells' Exiles]] were spared. Mekhi demanded he make a pact, to swear it in fire and brimstone. Evryn added that they'd need a better deal, they'd need full protection for the Exiles, not just safety in this moment. Olanthius told the party not to deal with Raragin, that no matter what their words would be twisted against them. Evryn revived Ilsa-vyx and revitalized the rest of the party.

Mekhi went to accept the deal, hand extended, wind battering against him and Raragin atop the Meat Grinder running at blazing speeds. Then he smashed Raragin's other hand, breaking the bones inside it, pushing him so hard his breastplate shattered. At this moment, something ejected from the [[Devils|Devil]]. It was a hand mirror of sorts, landing atop the [[Infernal War Machine|War Machine]], but it did not crack. Raragin screamed as he was forced again to flee, `"THEY ARE ALL DEAD!"`

The party comically flung his incapacitated lackeys out of the catapult back at him.
## To the Exiles
The party quickly deduced that the mirror was a means of communication, not with the [[Warlord Gangs]], but likely with [[Zariel]] directly. They quickly came up with a semi-convoluted plan wherein they'd craft some illusion of [[Raragin]]. Mekhi would be speaking for Raragin, and after activating the mirror, they saw on the other side, a bald woman with black streaks running down her face, a blazing halo above her head. In Infernal, Mekhi said that the party had struck a deal with him and that they needed to call off the Warlords. Zariel seemed almost inclined to believe this, but was suspicious. What followed was a surprisingly well-acted conversation where the party, as Raragin, successfully convinced Zariel to request the Warlords delay their assault.

As they neared [[The River Styx]], the party quickly worked to find a way across it. Even with the extra time afforded to them, they couldn't afford to wait for [[Koh Tam]]. Barely, with the combined powers of magic and might, the [[Infernal War Machine]] made it to the other side with minimal exposure to the Styx's accursed water.
## Pit-Stop
The party made a quick detour for [[Fort Knucklebones]], closer than it otherwise would've been. The party decided to split up in search of mercenaries, gear, repairs for [[The Meat Grinder]].
### Ilsa-vyx at the Tinker
Ilsa met with [[Clukka & Clonk]] for the first time and explained she was with the rest of the party, and also elaborated that they'd stolen [[The Meat Grinder]] from [[Feonor]] and [[The Golden Doom]]. They could get their vehicle repaired for 350 gold.
### Evryn and Kiarin at the Well
[[Koh Tam]] was speaking with a hooded Tiefling (not [[Rinne]]), and another unrelated Tiefling ([[Rinne]]). As they walked over, [[Kara]] spoke up to Evryn, saying that she wanted to kill Rinne ([[Session 19, 27 November 2024 - Union Dues|Session 19]]). Evryn told Kara that they were going to hire Rinne to help them, because despite how upsetting it might be, they needed to save the Exiles if they had any chance of getting Kara out of the coin. It cost them 250 gold to hire Rinne and they had to do a *little* convincing, but not much. Kiarin did accidentally divulge what seemed like some secret she wanted to keep but [[Levistus]] told the party some number of sessions ago, but that aside, everything (for the time being) was good and everything was fine.

Evryn took the opportunity to tell Rinne about Kara's current predicament (per Kara's request). He approached the topic hesitantly, and handed Kara's [[Soul Coin]] to Rinne. They argued, obviously, but continued along with the party.
### Mekhi at the Hostel
Mekhi found a bulk weapons shop where he ordered the whole stock for a total of 400 gold. 

He then paid a visit to [[Mezhikchen]]. He had a number of items for sale, including a giant wand-like device he'd ripped from an [[Infernal War Machine]] which could supposedly make something explode from a great distance. Mekhi bought it for the price of 5 platinum, some fine silks, and an ivory puzzle box (a single-use of *sunburst*). He also offered up [[The Big Gulp]], for which Mekhi parted with a [[Soul Coin]] under the promise that after drinking it he'd either see or become god (immunity to all damage for an undefined duration).
## All Together Now
The party reunited and traveled north. Evryn checked in on [[Olanthius]]. "I don't like this place," Olanthius said. "The evil spreads like smoke."

Evryn asked, "Ready to beat up some [[Devils]] at least?"

"I suppose if there is some joy to be found here, it should be in vanquishing Devils."

Thankfully, with the pace they'd traveled, the party arrived at the [[Exiles' base]] before the [[Warlord Gangs|Warlords]], though surely not by much. They ran into [[Hellripper]] who they quickly informed about the situation. She led the party deeper into the base.

Hellripper thanked the party for bringing so many armaments, and [[Uldrak]] and Ilsa-vyx rushed for [[Thiodon]] at the forge. Mekhi went to help Hellripper, leaving Evryn and Kiarin to speak with [[Celosia]].
## Celosia
[[Celosia]] was unwell. She still had Evryn's harp, and was happy to see her son, but the feeling was fleeting. Evryn informed his mother that [[Zariel]] knew of the base, and that there were forces on their way. Celosia asked if they were willing to defend the base alongside Hellripper. They were, of course.

"Are you going to be alright for any sort of fight?" Evryn asked. "[[Hellripper]] said that you've been... sick."

"Hellripper worries a lot," Celosia said. "I promise I will do my part for the good of my people. And Evryn," she held the harp in her hands, "thank you for this. I know I don't play as well as your father, but I've been practicing."

"That makes me... happy to hear."

As Celosia stood to leave, Evryn noted she didn't move as swiftly as she used to. Despite the speed and strength of her recovery, she was not the hero she once was.
## Thiodon
[[Uldrak]] and Ilsa-vyx rushed toward [[Thiodon]]. She almost slew Uldrak, and was suspicious even when he spoke in Giant to her. As a test, Thiodon reached out her elbow and Uldrak returned the gesture, smashing his against hers. This was sufficient. They took him to Celosia to restore his true form. It would take some time, but should it happen in time he would be able to help with the defense.

They exited the base and were met with a veritable army of [[Infernal War Machine|War Machines]].
