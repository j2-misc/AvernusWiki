# Synopsis
Located in the south of [[The High District]], the High Hall is a grand, looming cathedral where [[Elturel]]'s political and religious authorities congregate to discuss policies, host religious services, and administer aid to the sick and needy.

Now, the High Hall acts as a camp for people turned refugees within their own city's walls ([[Session 3, 26 June 2024 - The Battle of Elturel pt. 1|Session 3]]).
