A staff of great magical power. Currently it is incomplete and the whereabouts of the pieces are unknown, but according to [[The Hidden Lord]], if the item is finished it could free [[Elturel]].

According to The Hidden Lord, there was a fragment submerged in a [[Lake of Slime]] northwest of the [[Exiles' base]]. They collected this piece and were informed of the presence of two more ([[Session 13, 4 October 2024 - Once More the Tomb Disturbed|Session 13]]).
