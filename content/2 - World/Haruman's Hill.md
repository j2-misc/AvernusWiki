# Synopsis
A hill where [[Haruman]] kept the [[Hellriders]] who refused to swear allegiance to him when he was reborn as a [[Devils|Devil]] under [[Zariel]] in order to torment them for all eternity. The party was able to free the twenty-four hellriders, including a woman named [[Helen]]. At the top of the hill, they saw [[Jander]], one of Zariel's former generals impaled on a tree, as with the other Hellriders ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024 - Haruman's Hill|Session 10]]).
