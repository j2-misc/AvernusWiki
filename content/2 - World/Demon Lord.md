Counter to the rigid and strict structure of [[Devils]] the actual title of Demon Lord seems to be little more than a distinct collection of the strongest of [[Demons|Demonkind]]. Regardless of vague denotative meaning, the connotation carries weight. If something is a demon lord, it is best avoided.
