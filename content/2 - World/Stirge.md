Sometimes called "Stingbats," stirges are like mosquitoes the size of bats. They're not typically a problem above ground, tending to prefer darker locales such as dungeons, crypts. Stirges can even be found in [[Avernus]], most densely concentrated around locations like [[Haruman's Hill]] where they would feast on the blood of the damned ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024 - Haruman's Hill|Session 10]]).
