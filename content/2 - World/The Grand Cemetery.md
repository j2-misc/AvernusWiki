# Synopsis
Located in the southwest of [[Westerly]], this sprawling cemetery contains thousands of graves. Memorials and chapels within the cemetery are dedicated to honoring the noble dead, preserving knowledge of final rites and alms, and hosting funeral services.

Immediately following [[Elturel#The Descent|Elturel's Descent]], the cemetery was overrun with undead. [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]] sent [[Zythan Avhoste]] to investigate, but he was captured by a vampiric monster, [[Gideon Brightscored]], masquerading as the chapel's caretaker. After dealing with the threat and freeing Zythan, [[Evryn]] was able to speak with [[Lina]], whose soul had been trapped in a [[Soul Coin]] and carry on her tale. The party also found [[The Helm of Torm]] which allowed the party to see [[Idyllglen|The Razing of Idyllglen]] ([[Session 5, 31 July 2024 - Graveyard Shift|Session 5]]).
