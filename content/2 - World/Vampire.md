Undead parasites that feed on the blood of the living. Vampires are often formerly humanoid, having been turned into a vampire (willingly or not) by an elder vampire through a process often referred to as "corruption".

Vampires possess a unique set of weaknesses, the most notable of which is their hypersensitivity to the sun. A vampire exposed to sunlight for only a few seconds will be permanently destroyed. Vampires--and all undead--are said to lack souls, however the presence of vampires like [[Jander]] in [[Baator]] confuses this notion somewhat.
