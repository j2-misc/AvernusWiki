# Synopsis
In the year of 1494 DR, Elturel is the capital of the nation of Elturgard, a powerful and prosperous theocracy. [[Thavius Kreeg]], the high overseer of Elturel, represents the head of the city's government and religion. Defending Elturel are the [[Hellriders]], a military organization of religious knights led by the [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius Dangremond]].
# Religion
Religion plays a major role in the lives of most citizens in Elturel. The city's four primary gods are:
- [[Lathander]], God of Beginnings and Renewal
- [[Helm]], God of Protection and Vigilance
- [[Tyr]], God of Justice and Order
- [[Torm]], God of Duty and Loyalty

# The Companion
Distinguishing Elturel from other cities, [[The Companion]] hangs above Elturel like a second sun, bathing the city in holy light. According to recent history, when a vampire lord and his army invaded the city, the priest Thavius Kreeg prayed to Torm for divine intervention. Such intervention resulted in the miraculous appearance of the Companion, which disintegrated the vampire lord and his armies. Since then, the Companion has prevented undead from entering the city. Many view the Companion as proof of the gods' favor towards Elturel.
# The Descent
Thanks to the plotting of a [[Zariel|Zarielite]] cult led by a man called [[Zalryr]], The Companion was used by Zariel to drag Elturel into [[Avernus]] in an act of petty revenge enacted upon a city's worth of people who could never have known.
