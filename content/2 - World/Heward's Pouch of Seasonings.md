Food in [[Baator]] tastes only of ash. Heward's Pouch of Seasonings is one way to circumvent this. It is said that this magical pouch of seasonings can make even the most mundane or repugnant of dishes taste as though kissed by the tears of a unicorn. Supposedly they have one at [[The Infernal Rapture]], a traveling restaurant in [[Avernus]].

[[Mordenkainen]] gave [[Ilsa-Vyx]] one such pouch as thanks for her and the party clearing out [[The Tower of Urm]] of [[Yugoloths]] ([[Session 10, 4 September 2024|Session 10]]).
