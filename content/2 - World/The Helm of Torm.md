A holy relic capable of allowing the wearer to commune directly with [[Torm|Torm the True]]. [[Evryn]] used it per [[Ramius Dangremond|High Rider Ramius]]'s request and the party was made to witness [[Zariel]] and her five generals swear to protect [[Idyllglen]] only to see it razed by demons ([[Session 6, 7 August 2024 - Idyllglen|Session 6]]).
