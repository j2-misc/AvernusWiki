# Synopsis
The middle district north of [[The High Hall]] represents [[Elturel]]'s wealthiest district. Long ago, a prohibition forbade those outside the nobility or high clergy from living within the High District, although this prohibition is no longer in effect. Nonetheless, the city's most affluent and influential figures call this district home.

Now, the High District lies largely in ruin like much of the rest of Elturel, following its [[Elturel#The Descent|descent]] ([[Session 3, 26 June 2024 - The Battle of Elturel pt. 1|Sessions 3]], [[Session 4, 3 July 2024 - The Battle of Elturel pt. 2|4]], and [[Session 5, 31 July 2024 - Graveyard Shift|Session 5]]).
