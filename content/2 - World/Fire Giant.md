A type of giant (inordinately large, humanoid-shaped creatures) with an affinity for fire. Fire Giants are said to have unparalleled craftsmanship, though this is sometimes disputed by Stone Giants, Azer, the snootier of Elves, and the prouder of Dwarves.

[[Bel]], former [[Archdevil]] of [[Avernus]] had previously enslaved a small tribe of Fire Giants, forcing them to create [[Hellfire Weapons]] for the [[The Blood War|war effort]]. [[Uldrak]] tried and failed to free them, resulting in his temporary transformation into a [[Spined Devil]], but the party was ultimately able to rescue them from [[Bel's Forge]] during the events of [[Session 23, 8 January 2025 - Hellfire|Session 23]].
