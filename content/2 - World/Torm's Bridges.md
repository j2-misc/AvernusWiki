# Synopsis
Two bridges (Torm's Blade and the other one), spanning across a major ravine, connect the western and eastern halves of [[Elturel]]. Some divine magic permeates through the bridges even now, which was instrumental in fighting back the [[Devils]] immediately following [[Elturel#The Descent|Elturel's Descent]] into [[Avernus]] ([[Session 3, 26 June 2024 - The Battle of Elturel pt. 1|Session 3]])
