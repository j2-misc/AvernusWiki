The Sword of Zariel is no mortal weapon, and possesses some of her divine spark. [[Lulu]] suggested that if it was reintroduced to the [[Zariel|Zariel the Fallen]] that it could turn her good again.

Its exact whereabouts are unknown but it is believed to be in [[the cyst]], having been taken there in the wake of Zariel's fall by [[Lady Yael]] for just such a purpose.
