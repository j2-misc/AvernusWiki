![[SoulCoin.png]]
A magical item common in the [[Baator|Hells]] that houses a soul. Soul Coins are exchanged as currency at shops such as those in the [[The Wandering Emporium]] or [[Fort Knucklebones]] (roughly equivalent to fifty gold), and they also act as an important source of fuel for [[Infernal War Machine|Infernal War Machines]].
