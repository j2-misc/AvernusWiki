# Synopsis
A traveling restaurant where, supposedly, the food doesn't taste like ash. The party visited the establishment during their first trip to [[The Wandering Emporium]], where they filled it with rats, permanently glued [[Mahadi]]'s hands together, stole a [[The Meat Grinder|car]], and a [[Lulu|waitress]], and a [[Gargauth|giant demon]] ([[Session 15, 16 October 2024 - Lulu's Rapture|Session 15]]).
