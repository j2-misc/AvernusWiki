An Infernal Contract is a magically binding pact trafficked typically by high-ranking [[Devils]]. Not much is known to mortals about the specifics of how they work or why they work, but the physical contract itself seems to hold much of the binding power. Consequently, middlemen like the [[Ninth City Advocacy Services]] specialize in drafting and (more importantly) safeguarding these Infernal Contracts in secure vaults located throughout the [[Baator|Hells]].
