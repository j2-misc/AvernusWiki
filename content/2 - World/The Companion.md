Distinguishing [[Elturel]] from other cities, the Companion hangs above Elturel like a second sun, bathing the city in holy light. According to recent history, when a vampire lord and his army invaded the city, the priest [[Thavius Kreeg]] prayed to [[Torm]] for divine intervention. Such intervention resulted in the miraculous appearance of the Companion, which disintegrated the vampire lord and his armies. Since then, the Companion has prevented undead from entering the city. Many view the Companion as proof of the gods' favor towards Elturel.

Secretly, this was the result of a pact with [[Zariel]] which would later spell its doom as it was used by Zariel and a cult of hers run by [[Zalryr]] to drag Elturel into [[Avernus]].
